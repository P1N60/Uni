Is this how you define a type in python? I am used to doing so in F#:
type Country = str
type NeighbourRelation = list[(Country * Country)]
type Colour = list[Country]
type Colouring = list[Colour]
-------------------------------

from typing import List, Tuple
Country = str
NeighbourRelation = List[Tuple[Country, Country]]
Colour = List[Country]
Colouring = List[Colour]

Can you do it without the module?

Help me understand the functions in this python script. *VedhÃ¦ftede "colouring.py"*

I'll help you understand each function in this script. It appears to be implementing a map coloring algorithm, where the goal is to assign colors to countries/regions such that no adjacent regions share the same color.

Let's break down the key functions:

1. `simple()` and `involved()`
- These functions define different map configurations using tuples of neighboring regions
- `simple()` creates a simple map with 4 countries: da (Denmark?), se (Sweden?), no (Norway?), and de (Germany?)
- `involved()` creates a more complex map with regions 'a' through 'h' plus an 'ocean' and 'lake'

2. `isNeighbour(nr, country1, country2)`
```python
def isNeighbour(nr: NeighbourRelation, country1: Country, country2: Country) -> bool:
```
- Checks if two countries share a border
- Takes a list of neighbor relations and two countries as input
- Returns `True` if the countries are neighbors (share a border)
- Checks both orderings of the pair since (country1, country2) and (country2, country1) represent the same relationship

3. `canExtendColour(nr, country1, colour)`
```python
def canExtendColour(nr: NeighbourRelation, country1: Country, colour: Colour) -> bool:
```
- Checks if a country can be added to an existing color group
- Returns `True` if the country doesn't border any countries already in that color group
- This ensures we don't assign the same color to adjacent countries

4. `giveColour(nr, country, colouring)`
```python
def giveColour(nr: NeighbourRelation, country: Country, colouring: Colouring) -> Colouring:
```
- Assigns a country to a color group in the existing coloring
- If there are no existing color groups, creates a new one with just this country
- Otherwise, tries to add the country to an existing color group
- If it can't add to the first group, recursively tries with the remaining groups

5. `countries(nr)`
```python
def countries(nr: NeighbourRelation) -> Colour:
```
- Extracts a set of all unique countries from the neighbor relations
- Uses a set comprehension to flatten the pairs and remove duplicates

6. `colourCountries(nr)`
```python
def colourCountries(nr: NeighbourRelation) -> Colouring:
```
- The main function that colors all countries
- Gets the list of all countries
- Iteratively assigns each country to a color group using `giveColour`
- Returns the final coloring where no adjacent countries share the same color

At the end, there's also a `NeighbourRelation` class definition that provides an alternative way to represent the relationships, though it doesn't seem to be used in the main coloring algorithm.

Would you like me to explain any of these functions in more detail or help you understand how they work together?
