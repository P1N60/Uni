Speaking on the plane to Washington DC, Sir Keir said he hoped the UK-US relationship could go from ""strength to strength"". But the two leaders appear to be at odds over the importance of US security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal there. Sir Keir said discussions about potentially sending British troops to Ukraine were ongoing but he re-emphasised his belief in the importance of a so-called US ""backstop"". Asked what form he believed this backstop should take, he said: ""Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion but I'm not going to get ahead of myself on it, other than to say I'm very clear about what the principles are."" In contrast, Trump has said: ""I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much.  ""We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about Europe as the next door neighbour."" The president did add that the expected deal between Washington and Kyiv over access to Ukrainian minerals was ""great"" for Ukraine ""because they get us over there."" ""We will be on the land and that way there is going to be automatic security because nobody is going to be messing around with our people."" It is not yet known how much security support European leaders are asking for from America, nor is the scale of any American manpower on the ground in Ukraine associated with a minerals deal. The prime minister said: ""I'm considering how we preserve peace in Europe and how we get a lasting peace in Ukraine.  ""And I'm absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen we need security guarantees.  ""Precisely what that layers up to, what that looks like, is obviously a subject of intense discussion. We will play our part and I've been clear that we will need a US backstop of some sort. ""My concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him [Putin] the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see."" Speaking at a reception at the UK Ambassador's residence in Washington on Wednesday evening, the Sir Keir told guests that he wanted to strike a ""new partnership"" with the United States, and said ""our best days lie ahead"". On domestic policy, the prime minister said that ""taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style"" - a reference to an Elon Musk stunt at the conservative CPAC conference earlier this week - but said ""we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy"". Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador, said Trump was a ""very consequential president"" and that ""all the freedom-loving democracies in the world"" faced a ""very significant moment"". ""The US and the United Kingdom, we basically share everything together,"" he said. ""And of course one thing we don't need to fight over is trade, because we have this fantastically fair and balanced trade relationship when we reciprocate so much - that's just a little thing for you to remember in the coming weeks."" Tariffs on steel imports to the US are set to come into force in March, with the president also considering other import taxes as part of his drive to protect American businesses. After the visit from Sir Keir, Trump will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has said the deal on minerals is preliminary and that he still wants further agreements, arguing that without security guarantees from the US ""we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy, speaking to ITV's Peston programme, sounded hopeful about a deal. ""If US interests are on the ground in Ukraine, then that is the best security guarantee that the Ukrainians can have,"" he said.  Sir Keir was notably guarded in his remarks in advance of Thursday's meetings in the White House, such are the stakes and sensitivities around Ukraine, the Middle East and trade with America since Trump's inauguration. Strengthening and deepening the US-UK relationship might be his ambition, but it is far from guaranteed with such an unpredictable president. But asked if he could trust Trump, given what he had said in recent weeks, the prime minister replied: ""Yes, I've got a good relationship with him.  ""As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together."" Does he think President Trump sees Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine? ""Of course, the president has been very clear about the peace that he wants - he's right about that.  ""We all want peace - the question is, how do we make sure it's a lasting peace."" ""There's no issue between us on this,"" Sir Keir insisted. Theresa May, former prime minister and Conservative peer, urged Sir Keir to tell Trump that Russia is the aggressor in Ukraine. Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, she said: ""Will he impress on President Trump that...the defence of Europe benefits the defence of America, and the Ukrainians are fighting for their independence and their sovereignty - principles which should be defended by all of us who value or benefit from economic and democratic freedom."" Earlier this week, the prime minister announced the UK would boost military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, a move seen as an attempt to curry favour with the US president who has frequently attacked European countries for failing to spend more on defence.  The increase is being funded by a cut to the foreign aid budget which has angered international development charities and some of the prime minister's own MPs.  The UK's former security adviser Lord Sedwill told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was taking the right tack in increasing defence spending and urging its European neighours to do the same. He said: ""By showing we're willing to do more on defence... to build that capability, I think we're showing that Europe will step up and that's the best way to keep the US invested, even under a Trump presidency.""  In addition to the Ukraine war, talks are also expected to take in a discussion about trade and artificial intelligence. Downing Street wants what it calls ""further integration"" between the two countries' technology sectors. The potential flashpoints for Sir Keir are numerous and considerable - it is a landmark moment in his first year as prime minister.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8yy0116y8o,2025-02-27T16:06:20.591Z,Paul Burnell,MP Mike Amesbury's jail term suspended on appeal,"MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal.","MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal. The Runcorn and Helsby MP assaulted Paul Fellows, 45, following a row in Frodsham, Cheshire, last year and was jailed by magistrates on Monday. Amesbury, who had the Labour whip removed in October, launched an appeal and a judge said that while the length of the sentence had been ""spot on"", it should be suspended for two years. Judge Steven Everett, sitting with two magistrates at Chester Crown Court, also ordered Amesbury to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Amesbury must also undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course, and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work. His sentence still leaves the 55-year-old MP, who now sits as an independent, at risk of being ousted. If at least 10% of his constituents back a recall petition, a by-election will take place. Leaving court, Amesbury refused to answer questions from the waiting media about whether he would resign as an MP. But he said: ""I'd like to reiterate that I sincerely apologise once again to Mr Fellows and his family. ""I'm now going to go and see my family, and go home, and I'll give a statement at a later stage."" Video footage of the assault, which happened near a taxi rank in the early hours of 26 October, which was played in court. It showed Amesbury punching Mr Fellows in the head, knocking him to the ground. The politician then hit him at least five more times and swore at him. Amesbury was then heard saying: ""You won't threaten your MP again, will you?"" Judge Everett told Amesbury the facts showed him ""in a truly unfavourable light"" and, as an MP, he ""should be showing an example"".  While acknowledging it would be wrong to sentence him differently because he was an MP, the judge added: ""That doesn't mean we can't take into account that your behaviour as an MP was simply disgraceful."" He said he also could not ignore Amesbury's ""heavy drinking and fighting"". The former Labour politician had arrived at court in a prison van and wore handcuffs as he was led into the building. The court heard that, in a prepared statement given in a police interview, Amesbury claimed he had been approached by a man ""shouting and screaming"" about local and national matters. The MP said that, because he was terrified and the other man's ""arms were swinging"", he felt he had no option but to ""defend"" himself. But the judge told him the CCTV pictures revealed a very different story. ""In reality, you told the police a pack of lies. Nothing more, nothing less,"" he said. Judge Everett questioned why a charge of affray - which can carry a longer sentence - had not been brought by the prosecution. Daniel Travers, defending Amesbury, told the court: ""He's now had three nights in prison which is an experience he will never forget, certainly."" He said the ""public shaming"" and ""embarrassment"" had had a huge impact on his client.  ""This is a man who will certainly rehabilitate,"" said Mr Travers. ""He will learn a very painful lesson."" The confirmation of Amesbury's prison sentence, even though it has now been suspended, could still result in him being ousted from the Commons. The long-time Labour politician has been sitting as an independent MP for the last four months, following his suspension by party bosses. Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence a ""recall petition"" is triggered. After hearing from Chester Crown Court, the Speaker of the House of Commons will contact the returning officer for Amesbury's Runcorn and Helsby constituency. Constituents will then have six weeks to ask for their MP's removal by registering at 10 nominated places. If at least 10% of them vote to remove Amesbury, a by-election will be called. It would be the first by-election since Labour came to power following the July 2024 general election. Having first been elected as a Labour MP in the Cheshire constituency of Weaver Vale in 2017, Amesbury comfortably won the Runcorn and Helsby seat which was created following boundary changes. He secured 53% of the vote and  enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000. Reform UK beat the Conservatives (16%) into second place.

Two people have been arrested following the attack at about 19:00 GMT on Wednesday at a property on Cobhorn Drive, south Bristol. Officers confirmed the dog has now been put down. Initial reports suggested it may be an XL bully, but police said it was too early to confirm the breed. A man and woman, both in their 20s, are in custody after being arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death and possession of a prohibited breed of dog. The woman's family have been informed and are being supported by a specially trained officer, police said. A neighbour who lives close to the scene said the woman had only lived in the property a few weeks. ""She seemed a lovely girl,"" said the neighbour, who did not wish to give her name. ""I am still trying to process this. I was up all night awake trying to process this. ""I am shocked. I just can't believe it's happened and she hasn't been there that long."" Referring to the dog owner, the neighbour said: ""The moment she walked out the door I could hear her, and I ran over to her and said, 'Are you okay?' ""She couldn't talk or say a word. It was like she wasn't there because of the shock."" Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Insp Terry Murphy, from Avon and Somerset Police, called the incident ""incredibly rare"". ""The circumstances [officers] faced were ""immensely difficult"", he said. ""Our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family of the young woman who's tragically died as a result of yesterday evening's incident. ""A full investigation is now well under way to establish the full circumstances of the events that led to her death."" Police do not consider there to be any ongoing risk to the public, he added, but there will be increased police presence in the area over the coming days. He declined to comment on whether the woman who died lived at the address where the incident happened, or if there had been previous police contact with the household. Doreen Tovey said the incident was ""very frightening"". ""I came out my house to see what all the commotion was,"" she said. ""[There were] loads of police cars, riot van, ambulance across the road from me."" Resident Gary Steadman said he heard ""screaming"" and that the incident was heart-breaking.  He also described the dog as ""big, butch and brown and white"" in colour. The road has reopened following a closure for investigative work on Wednesday night.

Hughes was one of several general knowledge experts who regularly appeared on the show, which saw members of the public take on the five so-called ""Eggheads"". A statement posted on the show's Facebook and X accounts on Thursday, reported by the Press Association news agency, paid tribute to an ""Eggheads great"". ""It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of Eggheads great Chris Hughes,"" it read. ""Chris joined the show in 2003 and over the next 20 years gave us not only brilliant answers but very many laughs and happy memories."" It concluded: ""He will be hugely missed by all his Eggheads family."" Hughes was born in Middlesex and attended Enfield Grammar School. Before becoming known as one of the country's leading quizzers, he worked as a train driver and railway worker.  He went on to become a regular contributor on Eggheads - which began on BBC Two in 2003 before moving to Channel 5 in 2020.  The Eggheads panel was made up of general knowledge experts, including winners from others shows such as Mastermind, The Weakest Link and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. In each episode, five Eggheads would compete with a team made up of five members of the public, who would play individually against a single Egghead in each round, before a final face-off between the remaining players of both sides.  If the amateurs were successful, they would take home a cash prize. The jackpot would increase by £1,000 per episode, with each edition's prize money rolling into the next day if the Eggheads won. As a result of the Eggheads high level of expertise, many of the jackpots would reach a sizeable sum before finally being won. The highest ever jackpot reached £75,000, which was won by a team in 2007. The series was presented by news presenter Dermot Murnaghan, before Radio 2 DJ and Channel 5 talk show host Jeremy Vine took over the role. Hughes is one of only seven people to have won both Brain of Britain and Mastermind, and also scored a victory on International Mastermind. Eggheads producer Robert Dean said on X: ""[Hughes] was an amazing Egghead who considered everyone on the production team part of his family.  ""I have such fond memories of him and count myself lucky to have known him. I'll miss him tremendously."" After having reached the final of another hit quiz show, The Weakest Link, without getting a single question wrong, host Anne Robinson declared Hughes to be ""the best contestant we have had on the Weakest Link"" and chose not to use her mean spirited signature catchphrase: ""you are the Weakest Link, goodbye!"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjdz9q170yo,2025-02-27T11:59:24.643Z,"Sean Dilley, Molly Stazicker, Esme Stallard & Mitchell Labiak",Gatwick second runway backed by government,"A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.","A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""minded to approve"" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed. The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade. The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission. If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The £2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment. ""I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,"" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday. Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has ""outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year"" and that the airport would ""engage fully"" in the process. The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month. Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year. On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was ""not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior"". The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.  An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights. Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is ""full"". Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.  It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings. But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners. Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. ""The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,"" he added. Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country. ""People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,"" he added. Union Unite backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need ""to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers"". Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be ""a win for everyone"". She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.  ""That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice."" Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about ""uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change"". ""We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,"" she said.  The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added. Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise. On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels. Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released. But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF. The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying. At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.

Rhianan Rudd, 16, downloaded bomb manuals, guides on guerrilla warfare and media glorifying white supremacy and Nazism, Chesterfield Coroner's Court was told. Her mother referred her to the deradicalisation programme Prevent - but she was later arrested by counter-terrorism officers and then placed under investigation by MI5. The court heard several months after the charges were dropped, Rhianan was found dead at a children's home in Nottinghamshire on 19 May 2022. Aged 15, she was the youngest girl charged with terror offences in the UK, before the prosecution was discontinued. Before the inquest evidence began, a statement paying tribute to Rhianan was read out on behalf of her mother, Emily Carter. In it, she said her daughter had a love of horses and cats and had a passion for cooking, which was ""one of the times she was the happiest"" and that art became an outlet ""when she couldn't say something"". But Ms Carter said Rhianan - who was autistic - became ""fixated"" on things due to her condition, and said: ""Her being groomed was huge and I saw her change and it had a huge impact on her."" An email was read out from Rhianan's mother to Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands (CTPEM) requesting help from the Prevent programme. It said: ""I need help with my 15-year-old daughter. She has a very unhealthy outlook on fascism – she also has massive dislikes for certain races and creeds. ""I have done my best to deter her from any such ideologies, but it seems to be falling on deaf ears. I would like some help on the matter."" The subsequent referral form said this started off as an interest in world wars, but then turned towards a ""fixation on Hitler"" and admiration for him. ""She classes herself as a fascist and has quite a lot of hate towards other races,"" the form stated. Ms Carter said they were waiting for hospital treatment for Rhianan's mental health. The court also heard Rhianan had a ""history of self-harm"". A report by CTPEM, in September 2020, outlined that a joint assessment had taken place and said ""it does not meet the criteria for [a criminal investigation]"", but if ""things escalated"" then it would be referred back to them. Edward Pleeth, counsel for the inquest, read out another report from CTPEM later that month, which detailed that Rhianan had told her mother she ""wants to go to a synagogue and blow it up"", and has spoken about ""slitting people's throats"". The report said: ""[We need] to ascertain her online presence i.e. who is she speaking to? Is she being coerced by anybody in her way of thinking?"" Disclosure from MI5 was read to the court, which showed Rhianan was speaking to Chris Cook, a 23-year-old neo-Nazi from the US who sent her ""racially-motivated links"" to read.  The inquest was told the then-partner of Rhianan's mother, American Dax Mallaburn, also had an influence which was ""not known"" to Ms Carter. The inquest heard a student at Rhianan's school provided a statement to senior staff, in which she repeated a desire to ""blow up a synagogue"". In October 2020, Supt Stephen Riley, head of CTPEM, told the court two police officers attended Rhianan's home in Bolsover, Derbyshire, seizing a USB memory stick and a diary from her. Analysis found PDF manuals on how to make a bomb and material of a far-right nature. CPTEM then passed the information on to MI5, which opened an investigation. The court was told on 20 October 2020, during a meeting, that police and MI5 had decided Rhianan would not be arrested because it was ""believed to risk some impact on her mental health"" and ""could possibly lead to further self-harm and suicide attempts"". But after Rhianan was admitted to hospital in Chesterfield that same day after ""carving a swastika"" on to her forehead, the court was told a decision was made the following day to arrest her due to ""new information and a risk to others"". Despite Rhianan being assessed by Prevent after her mother made a referral in September 2020, her case was closed after a criminal investigation began the following month. At that stage her case was deemed to be beyond the remit of the deradicalisation scheme. The inquest heard after Rhianan was arrested on 22 October 2020, MI5 discussed with the police officer running the investigation whether an ""exception"" on Prevent could be made for Rhianan, but the detective had said it could not. Supt Riley said the detective was ""following the guidance that was available in 2020"". Charges against Rhianan were dropped in late December in 2021, after a Home Office unit that deals with modern slavery and trafficking made a formal finding that she was a victim of exploitation. But the court heard the referral to the Home Office was not made by police after they began investigating Rhianan in autumn 2020.  Rather, the inquest heard it was only made at the instigation of defence lawyers after she was charged in April 2021. Supt Riley was questioned about whether there had been a missed opportunity for police to make a referral in November 2020, but he said that was not the case. The inquest heard in 2020, counter-terrorism officers did not receive training about modern slavery referrals, even though the relevant legislation had been in force since 2015.

Diabetes specialist Susan Hamilton joined Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 but resigned in January 2022 ""as a direct consequence of the actions of, and poor management by, the trust"". She cited ""cruel bullying behaviours"" by a colleague after a 2018 disagreement when she questioned his competency over a patient's treatment.  Her claim stated that Abdool Nayeck's behaviour also included ""ignoring morning greetings from her and facing the other way when [she] was presenting in meetings"". On Tuesday, the judgement by the London (South) Employment Tribunal awarding Ms Hamilton £41,000, was published.. After the 2018 incident over a patient who had collapsed at home, Ms Hamilton apologised to Mr Nayeck for her tone.  Ms Hamilton stated he later took her book, rubbed out her name and wrote his instead before storing it in a cupboard containing his own documents and books. The NHS trust has not publicly commented but is understood to have subsequently strengthened support for staff and rolled out a new training programme for managers. In a 2019 mediation session, Mr Nayeck agreed to ""follow advice regarding the tone of emails and not send every message as high priority"" and both agreed ""to communicate in a civil manner with each other at work"". Ms Hamilton's submission stated: ""I tried very hard to build a better relationship with Abdool particularly following mediation.  ""I have offered him tea or coffee, have tried to talk to him about, for example, how he enjoyed his Eid celebrations… I have not had any reciprocal treatment from Abdool. ""The only change that occurred from [Mr Nayeck's] side is that he no longer made drinks for the team in the morning so by extension I was no longer specifically excluded in that regard."" In 2021, a letter was sent to Ms Hamilton stating ""there was no evidence to show that you had shown bullying behaviour"" towards Mr Nayeck, who had lodged a complaint. Ms Hamilton was again signed off by her GP in August 2021 with ""work-related stress"" and was undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy when she resigned in January 2022. ""I could not handle another year of going through this,"" Ms Hamilton told the tribunal.  ""I was really suffering."" In her judgment, employment judge Kathryn Ramsden said Ms Hamilton's testimony was ""powerful"". She wrote: ""She was a gifted nurse, who loved her job and she was immensely distressed to have found herself in a situation where she could not do it. ""On the trust's own evidence Mr Nayeck's conduct and communications towards the claimant continued to fall far short of the standards it expected, and yet it appeared to do very little beyond speaking to Mr Nayeck – which evidently made no difference - except for make suggestions that it did not then follow through.""

The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school ""there would have been no way I would have agreed to it"". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being ""groomed"" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: ""I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible."" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that ""this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion."" He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was ""driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love"". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy's parents believe ""and in my judgement with reason"" that their son has ""at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives"". The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be ""yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London."" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was ""mocked"" and ""never settled in"" at the school in Ghana. He said he ""could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights"". The boy wrote that he was ""so scared and desperate"" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. ""I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,"" he wrote. He said he had been ""mistreated"" at the school, adding: ""I'm begging to go back to my old school."" However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was ""not a punishment but a measure to protect him"". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was ""every parent's worst nightmare"", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's ""destruction"". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had ""suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities"" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.  The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor ""involved in gangs in any way"". He said he ""does not know anyone involved in a gang"" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that ""my behaviour wasn't the best"" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: ""This has been a really difficult time for us all."" They added: ""Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family."" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a ""real shock"" to the teenager. ""He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully."" The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: ""I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than."" The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. ""Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,"" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where ""in their parents' eyes"" young people were ""falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours"". Following the judgment, he added: ""We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.""

According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021. The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002. The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022. The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the ""EU plus"" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog.  These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024. The number remains higher than before 2022. The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%.  Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023. There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024. The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were ""no quick fixes"" to the ""global"" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a ""serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system"". Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a ""broken asylum system"", saying Labour inherited a ""huge backlog"" of claims. ""We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again."" Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said ""many people want to come here"", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum. She underlined ""we have to be much tougher"" dealing with visa overstayers. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as ""no surprise,"" saying there was ""no deterrent"". Philp added that the blame for the numbers ""lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border"". The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create ""more safe routes"" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK. ""Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option,"" Bhutta said in a statement. ""For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here."" New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that  anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship. The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs.  The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was ""encouraged"" the government continued to work on the ""broken asylum system"" during its first six months in power. However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people ""stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work"". The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023. The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament. The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation. While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped. The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes – including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa. The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK. The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000. This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000). Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route. The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas. But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year. In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers. A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration. Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford,  referred to a ""boom and bust"" in some visa categories over recent years. ""The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,"" he said.  ""Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

","People who have already had norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, could be at risk of catching it again this season, experts from the the UK's Health Security Agency say.  Data shows a different strain of the virus is on the rise and having had one strain doesn't necessarily protect you from catching another, they advise. Norovirus can be particularly severe for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.  Cases are currently still ""exceptionally high"" with numbers at more than double the five-season-average for this time of year, latest figure show. Amy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said the biggest impact was being seen in hospitals and care homes.  ""With multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season,"" she added. Cases have been higher than expected partly because of the emergence of a recent strain of the virus called GII.17, but also because of improved ways of testing for the virus.  Data now shows that a different, but more commonly seen strain, is on the rise.  This means people who have already had the bug could catch it again as having one version of the virus does not fully protect you against the other.  There is no suggestion that either strain leads to more severe illness than expected, however. Norovirus cases usually starts to decline as the weather warms up, but the UKHSA says it is too soon to work out whether cases have peaked.  The total remains close to its record high, with an average of 1,134 patients a day in hospital with norovirus last week – down slightly on the previous week (1,160), but still nearly two and a half times that seen in the same period last year. Symptoms of norovirus include: If you think you may have norovirus, experts advise: Many household disinfectants do not work well against the virus. Nor do alcohol hand gels. If you are concerned - for example if a young child is not able to keep fluids down or the illness does not stop after a few days - make sure you seek medical advice Do not visit hospitals and care homes or prepare food for others, until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped. Nurses working with call handlers at East Midlands Ambulance Service are helping to ease pressure. The application says it would make it one of the most sustainable healthcare sites in the country. Former Arsenal and Everton striker Kevin Campbell died aged 54 after treatment for a heart infection.  Seven hospices will be able to use the money for projects like buying equipment, renovations and IT. A Wiltshire care provider says the financial situation of the care sector is ""really worrying"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce30nrnpwygo,2025-02-27T13:01:46.510Z,Megan Bonar,The island split over where to build a new high school,"For decades, children on Mull have been divided by the location of the island's only high school.","For decades, children on Mull have been divided by the location of the island's only high school. Pupils living in the north of Scotland's fourth largest island go to school in Tobermory, its main settlement. But most of those living over an hour-and-a-half's drive away in the south face having to leave their families and catch a ferry to Oban on the Scottish mainland, where they stay in boarding school hostels during the week. With Tobermory High School falling into a state of disrepair and plans being made to build a multi-million pound replacement, many of those in the south see it as a chance to put right what they regard as being a historical injustice. They are campaigning for the new school to be based in a more central location such as Craignure, which is home to the main ferry port and the island's hospital. This would allow pupils from both ends of the island to attend the same school - so children in the south would be able to stay at home once they reach secondary school age. But some parents in the north of the island want the new school to be built close to the site of the existing high school in Tobermory. Argyll and Bute Council has shortlisted four options for the location of the new school, and had been due to make a decision on Thursday - but the vote has been delayed until a special meeting of the council on 7 March.   The new development will be a replacement for the current high school, meaning wherever it is built it will be a campus made up of a nursery, primary and secondary school. Choosing any location apart from Tobermory would leave the town with no school. Many community members had hoped that a ""split option"" would be made available allowing a central high school to be built as well a new primary school and nursery for the community of Tobermory, but the council says that is too expensive. Marion MacLean lives in Tobermory and her two daughters currently attend the high school. While the decision won't directly impact on her family, Marion feels this is the ""one chance to get it right for every child that lives on the island"". While she feels it is important not be ""remiss of the feelings"" of families in the Ross of Mull, she has concerns about the impact on the village she has called home all her life. She told BBC Scotland News: ""Tobermory can't lose its primary school.  ""It would have a huge impact on the businesses on the high street, and I think we would lose that community feel of having the children around the town during the day."" Four miles off the main road through the Ross of Mull is the village of Carsaig, which is home to Amy Simpson and her daughters Daisy, six, and Rosie, four. Amy said that if the council's preferred option of a new school in Tobermory is selected she would feel forced to leave her village when her kids reach secondary school age, rather than be separated from them if they had to board in Oban. She added: ""We love our life here, we have become an integral part of our community. ""We don't want to leave and we don't want to take our kids out of this community, this is where they were born and where they are growing up."" Fifty miles south of Tobermory, a journey which takes around an hour-and-a-half in a car due to the single track roads, is the village of Bunessan. Rob Claxton-Ingham, who lives on a croft with his husband, said the future was uncertain as he doesn't know where his foster child will attend secondary school. As things stand, she faces travelling and boarding in Oban every week - like all children on the south of the island. He told BBC Scotland News: ""As a foster carer, our child has faced separation and loss already from her birth family and has had to transition to us as her substitute carers. ""The thought of her transitioning again at the age of 11 to a school, over the sea, where she has to get a ferry, where she won't get our day-to-day support, is hard."" Rob said high school has always been ""an issue"" for the community, and people have ""learned to be as ok as they can be with it"". ""But this situation is developing something new and it really hurts that Argyll and Bute Council could develop something new and, actually while doing that plan, to continue excluding people at this end of the island,"" he added. Rebekah MacLean and her four kids also live in the village of Bunessan. Her youngest children attend the local primary school, but for her secondary-aged children things are a little bit more complicated. She said: ""For me, what I am seeking is equality across the island for all children whether that's primary age, early education or secondary students. ""One key aspect of that is the secondary school being centrally based, so all the children can attend and no child has to be put in the position of choosing between education and family."" Rebekah has managed to make arrangements for her son, Jude, 15, to stay with a family friend in Tobermory during the week so he is slightly closer to home, while her daughter, Acacia, 14, is home-schooled. Jude is also in favour of a centrally-located school so that when it comes to his siblings' time to go to high school, they can stay at home and have a less uninterrupted education than him. He said: ""I do worry that because I have to travel so far, I have less time in school. ""I want to be an engineer, that requires straight As.  ""I worry I won't be able to get those because I have to travel so much and I'm maybe behind in class."" It is clear that the debate on where the new school should be built is an issue that is consuming islanders. Everywhere you go, everyone has an opinion on it. Argyll and Bute Council said: ""Building a new 2-18 campus on Mull is Argyll and Bute Council's single biggest investment, estimated at £43m. ""Following extensive community engagement and detailed assessments, councillors will consider a report recommending a preferred site on 27 February with a motion already tabled to hold a special meeting to consider the issue on 7 March."" The difference between the qualifications obtained by Scotland's richest and poorest pupils increased last year. Unions said the plans would result in ""devastating cuts"" and called for Edinburgh University to use some of its assets instead. Parents at a nursery in the Borders fear its low child numbers could see it declared ""inactive"". The survey hit the headlines in 2021 after asking pupils as young as 14 about their sexual experiences. Pupil numbers are set to fall by 90,000 by 2040, but ministers want to maintain school staffing. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Lauren Patel starred in the BAFTA-winning Vengeance Most Fowl and will travel with cast and creators to the ceremony in Hollywood after the film was nominated for an Academy Award. The long-awaited return of the animated stop-motion franchise from Aardman Animation was watched by 20 million people when the film aired on BBC One on Christmas Day. The 23-year-old, whose character was a firm favourite with fans of the film, said the audience response had been ""so above and beyond what I thought it was going to be"". She told BBC Radio Manchester being involved in the film was an ""incredible experience"", but added that the Oscars call came as a surprise.  ""I woke up, I had like that horrible flu that had been going around and I just had a text from my agent saying, 'oh, you're going to the Oscars in like two weeks',"" she said. ""And I thought I dreamt it in my weird, ill state. ""I don't even really know how it works.  ""And at this point I'm not questioning it. I'm just hoping they'll let me in when I show up."" The Bolton actor's turn as PC Mukherjee was a high point in the hilarious outing, as the intrepid new PC was central to the plot, helping the iconic title characters track down their penguin nemesis, the master of disguise Feathers McGraw. The film also featured the vocal talents of Patel's fellow Boltonian, comedian Peter Kay, who voiced PC Mukherjee's superior, Ch Insp Mackintosh. Creator and Preston-born Nick Park and his Bristol-based Aardman Animations team have already won four Oscars, so Patel said hopes were high that they would add to that achievement. ""The team are so insanely talented and their minds are brilliant and the script is so witty and so fun,"" she said.  ""It made it such an enjoyable job to work on [and they are] also just all lovely people. ""They've got Oscars and they're very successful, they're very well known.  ""But they're all just really lovely, down to earth people who just want to make the film as good as it can be."" The trip to the Oscars comes three years after Patel landed her first role in coming-of-age musical drama Everybody's Talking About Jamie.  That success came just days after she was rejected by a number of drama schools and she said she got the part in an open online audition. Since then, she said she ""fell head first"" into the industry, which was ""kind of mental"", and she recently joined the cast of BBC drama Waterloo Road for the latest series. She said becoming a professional actor was a dream come true. ""I never thought that I would be able to do it professionally in this capacity,"" she said. ""I was like, 'oh, maybe I'll go to drama school and then in like 10 years, I'll get a little bit on the telly and, and that'll be great'.  ""And I'll maybe do some community theatre because that's really fun.  ""But yeah, it's mad. I can't believe it. ""Everyone who has ever met me as a child would know that I loved singing and dancing and attention."" She said she was excited about every aspect of her trip and had chosen her all-important red carpet outfit. ""I wanted to find something that I felt really good in, that I felt represented who I was and I think I found that,"" she said. However, she added that she would keep the exact details of the outfit ""under wraps"". Above everything else though, she said there was one thing she was really looking forward to. ""I'm really excited to see Raye perform,"" she said. ""I love her so much and I've never seen her live and the first time I'm going to see her is at the Oscars, which is mental.""

It's a big day at their home: a beautician sits on their sofa, styling their hair and makeup. The room is warm with fun and laughter. It feels like a scene from a Jane Austen novel: three women in their late 20s, each of them bursting with personality, swapping stories. And like most Austen novels, the conversation often turns to marriage. The sisters are preparing for a family wedding at the weekend - where the bride and groom are first cousins. Many people might find this unusual, but in their family and in some parts of Bradford, it's fairly common. Ayesha, who at 29 is the oldest of the three sisters, also married her first cousin in 2017. She has two children with her husband and their marriage is happy, she says. It felt perfectly normal at the time to marry her cousin. Their mother, a Pakistani migrant, assumed it was what all three of her daughters would do. But 26-year-old Salina, the youngest of the three, tells us she broke the mould by having what they call a ""love"" marriage, choosing a partner from outside the family. Salina tells us she is outgoing and ambitious; marrying a cousin simply did not appeal to her. Then there's Mallika, who at 27 is the middle of the three. She's still single and has already decided not to marry within her family. ""I said to my mum that I wouldn't judge my sisters but I wasn't going to do it,"" Mallika tells us. She says having an education has created opportunities for her. ""Before, even if you had an education, you wouldn't be expected to carry on with it. You would be thinking of marriage. Now the mindset is so different."" In the UK and across Europe, cousin marriage is coming under increased scrutiny - particularly from doctors, who warn that children of first cousins are more likely to experience an array of health problems. And there's now some new, potentially worrying data from Bradford to add into that mix. Researchers at the city's university are entering their 18th year of the Born in Bradford study. It's one of the biggest medical trials of its kind: between 2007 and 2010, researchers recruited more than 13,000 babies in the city and then followed them closely from childhood into adolescence and now into early adulthood. More than one in six children in the study have parents who are first cousins, mostly from Bradford's Pakistani community, making it among the world's most valuable studies of the health impacts of cousin marriage. And in data published in the last few months - and analysed in an upcoming episode of BBC Radio 4's Born in Bradford series -  the researchers found that first cousin-parentage may have wider consequences than previously thought. The most obvious way that a pair of blood-related parents might increase health risks for a child is through a recessive disorder, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.  According to the classic theory of genetics laid out by the biologist Gregor Mendel,  if both parents carry a recessive gene then there's a one in four chance that their child will inherit the condition. And when parents are cousins, they're more likely to both be carriers. A child of first cousins carries a 6% chance of inheriting a recessive disorder, compared to 3% for the general population. But the Bradford study took a much broader view - and sheds fresh light. The researchers weren't just looking at whether a child had been diagnosed with a specific recessive disorder. Instead they studied dozens of data points, observing everything from the children's speech and language development to their frequency of healthcare to their performance at school. Then they used a mathematical model to try to eliminate the impacts of poverty and parental education - so they could focus squarely on the impact on ""consanguinity"", the scientific word for having parents who are related. They found that even after factors like poverty were controlled for, a child of first cousins in Bradford had an 11% probability of being diagnosed with a speech and language problem, versus 7% for children whose parents are not related. They also found a child of first cousins has a 54% chance of reaching a ""good stage of development"" (a government assessment given to all five year-olds in England), versus 64% for children whose parents are not related. We get further insight into their poorer health through the number of visits to the GP. Children of first cousins have a third more primary care appointments than children whose parents are not related - an average of four instead of three a year. What is notable is that even once you account for the children in that group who already have a diagnosed recessive disorder, the figures suggest consanguinity may be affecting even those children who don't have a diagnosable recessive disorder. Neil Small, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford and the author of the study, says that even if all of the children with recessive disorders visited their GP more than average, ""this does not explain the much wider distribution of excess health care usage in the consanguineous children"". The study, he says, is ""exciting because it gives the opportunity for a much more accurate development of a response, targeting interventions and treatments"". It is, of course, just one study, and the population of Bradford is not representative of the whole of the UK. Nevertheless, it adds to a growing concern among scientists that has caught the attention of lawmakers across Europe. Two Scandinavian countries have now moved to outlaw cousin marriage entirely. In Norway, the practice became illegal last year; in Sweden, a ban will come into effect next year. In the UK, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has introduced a private members' bill to outlaw the practice, adding it to the list of illegal marriages (alongside parents, child, siblings, and grandparents). But the Labour government says there are ""no plans"" to impose a ban. At present, the UK is still following the policy of ""genetic counselling"", in which first cousin-couples are educated about the risks of having children, and encouraged to get extra screening in pregnancy. But amid concern about child health and strains on the NHS, some academics are asking whether a beefed-up approach to counselling is needed, with more funding and laser-focused intervention. And there are those who think it's time to follow the Scandinavian example and impose something bound to be difficult and controversial: an outright ban on cousin marriage. For most in the UK, the prospect of marrying a cousin is largely alien. But it wasn't always so unusual. The father of evolution Charles Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Their son, the Victorian scientist Sir George Darwin, went on to estimate that cousin marriages accounted for almost one in 20 aristocratic unions in 19th Century Britain. One of them was Queen Victoria, who married her first cousin, Prince Albert. The novel Wuthering Heights is full of fictional examples. By the 20th Century the proportion of marriages between cousins had declined to about 1%. But it remains a relatively common practice among some South Asian minorities. In three inner-city Bradford wards, almost half (46%) of mothers from the Pakistani community were married to a first or second cousin, according to the most recent Born in Bradford data published two years ago. For those who want to ban the practice, the public health argument is compelling. When announcing his private members' bill in December, Richard Holden highlighted the higher risk of birth defects. Later, on Talk TV, he pointed to data showing that infant mortality rates are higher for children born to cousin parents, with more heart, brain, and kidney problems due to recessive disorders. He also explained that health effects can be ""compounded"" when the practice persists through generations. This risk to child health is one of the reasons Patrick Nash, a researcher and co-founder at the Pharos Foundation research institute, wants to see cousin marriage banned. In a paper published in the Oxford Journal of Law and Religion last year, Nash wrote that a ban would result in ""immediate"" health improvements, especially in communities where the practice is common. He said:  ""Banning cousin marriage would improve public health drastically and have no negative health implications of its own."" On the ground in Bradford, it's a more mixed picture. Prof Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist and researcher at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, has worked in the city for more than two decades. Over the years he has observed lots of severe genetic disorders. ""I've seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions"". He says it was ""immediately clear"" these conditions were occurring more in Bradford than elsewhere. He remembers some tragic examples: families who lost several children, one after the other, to the same genetic disorder. ""That's very upsetting and very difficult for the family to get their heads around."" But crucially, Prof Oddie thinks the main risk to genetic health in Bradford is not cousin marriage, but a similar issue known as endogamy, in which people marry members of their close community. In a tight-knit ethnic group, people are more likely to share common ancestors and genes - whether or not they are first cousins, he says. Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK's Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians. ""It's often the case that the exact familial tie can't be traced, but the gene occurs more commonly within a certain group, and for that reason, both parents carry the affected gene,"" Prof Oddie says. ""It's an oversimplification to say that cousin marriage is the root of all excess recessive disorders in Bradford or in Pakistani communities. Endogamy is an important feature."" Rather than a ban, he stresses the power of education - or what he calls ""genetic literacy"". It's a phrase that crops up again and again from the people we speak to. For many years there's been a campaign in Bradford to inform people in the Pakistani community about their genetic risks. Couples are given specialist advice at their GP; at pregnancy classes, information is shared with expectant mothers. And in Bradford at least, some are taking the message on board. Back at the sisters' house, all three women we interview say that ideas around cousin marriage are slowly changing, in part due to an increased awareness of health risks. They live in the deprived, post-industrial Manningham area of the city. There's a distinct feeling of neighbourliness here. All of the front doors open directly onto the street, which is full of children playing. Occasionally the sounds of their laughter drift inside. ""It has to be something that happens gradually - it's slow, you can't rush it,"" says Salina, the sister who chose to have a love marriage. ""My mum was very young when she came [to the UK from Pakistan]. She had certain views but those changed because she loves us. I just explained to her, 'Mum, how does it benefit you to push cousin marriage?'."" Mallika, her older sister, agrees. ""It's also to do with social media and being exposed to different people,"" she says. ""You have new connections... contact with people outside our parents' eyes."" Even Ayesha, the oldest sister who is in a cousin marriage, said she doesn't imagine either of her two children will marry their cousins. At the time she married her cousin, she says, ""I didn't know any different. My parents were strong in their culture. As the generations move on, the culture is disappearing a bit."" She was aware of the genetic risks when she had her two children. Neither of them have a genetic illness. ""We did take that on board,"" she says, on the topic of genetic health. ""But I always feel like if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. If the child is going to be born with a disability then it will happen if you are married to a cousin or not."" Indeed, in Bradford at least, the practice is in decline. The share of new mothers from across the Born in Bradford study who were first cousins with the father of their baby fell from 39% in the late 2000s to 27% in the late 2010s. This is no coincidence, according to Professor John Wright, chief investigator on the Born in Bradford project. He points out that it is only recently that his team published evidence around the risks of cousin marriage in the UK. ""When we talked to the families 10 years ago it was very clear that people weren't aware of the risks but like all parents they want to do their best for their children. They want to have healthy children,"" he says. ""Education is the starting point and we've shown in Born in Bradford how powerful that is."" Aside from health concerns, there's another reason some people want to see cousin marriage banned: its impact on social cohesion. This is what's largely driving the debate in Scandinavia. In Norway, where cousin marriage was banned last year, lawmakers said the practice was linked to forced marriage, with some South Asian immigrant women coerced into unions with relatives. They also looked at the link with so-called ""honour"" violence, according to Tonje Egedius, a journalist who covered the story for a Norwegian newspaper. ""[Police] claim that cousin marriage makes it easier for perpetrators to maintain honour in families,"" she says, ""and that marrying within the family is a contributing cause of honour-related violence and abuse"". Jasmina Holten, a senior Norwegian police officer, said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK last year that some women coerced into cousin marriage found themselves trapped, with financial dependence on relatives. In those cases, divorce often means ostracism. A ban on cousin marriage could break down that abusive chain, she said. Likewise, Sweden's justice secretary Gunnar Strömmer said his own country's ban on cousin marriage will liberate women from ""oppressive standards of honour"". This cultural argument is becoming increasingly prominent. Proponents of a ban broadly see cousin marriage as an instrument of segregation, siphoning people off from the rest of society. Nash, from the Pharos Foundation, says that a ban on cousin marriage would help reduce ethnic segregation in places like Bradford. Others are sceptical of the idea that you can force people to integrate through the sharp stick of legislation. They say that even if a ban goes ahead, some couples would continue to marry their cousins through illegal, unregistered unions - and that women in those marriages may feel they no longer have the protection of the state if the relationship goes sour. Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, tells us that ""thoughtful legislation"" would ""offer protections"" to people coerced into cousin marriage. ""[But] we must respect cultural diversity and personal choice,"" he says. ""Cousin marriage is an important cultural practice in many parts of the world, and legislation should be sensitive to the social and familial values that underlie it."" More broadly, he suggests governments may want to think about boosting education and genetic screening for couples entering cousin marriage - rather than imposing ""blanket bans"". For some, the idea of an outright ban raises the ugly image of certain minorities being targeted over others. Karma Nirvana, a charity that works to end honour-based abuse, described the backbench attempt to ban cousin marriage as ""a tool of political point-scoring, inciting hate and driving a wedge between communities"". Richard Holden's bill is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. Without government support it has never been likely to pass but its very existence and events in Scandinavia have resulted in cousin marriage being talked about far beyond the communities where it is prevalent. Of course, for those Britons in a cousin marriage, life goes on much as before. Back at the Bradford house, the beautician is putting her finishing touches to the hair of the three sisters, ahead of their big wedding at the weekend. Ayesha, the sister who is in a cousin marriage, is reflective and thoughtful about her own near decade-long relationship. ""There are difficulties - we've been through lots together, we have sacrificed a lot,"" she says about her husband. ""But we are happy together."" ""I think even with love marriages you're going to have problems. They'll just be different ones.""

","When 14-year-old Weronika Somerville woke up from brain surgery to remove a tumour, she didn't recognise the people in her hospital room.  They were her parents. On the way to a post-op scan, a medic started to talk to her.  He realised she had no idea who he was - despite the fact he was the surgeon who had carried out her procedure. Weronika had suffered a rare complication - unusual retrograde amnesia. She couldn't recall events or people from her past life. Her memories never returned. ""I only know from what my parents have told me,"" Weronika told BBC Scotland News. ""The doctors were checking if I knew them - I remember so many faces I hadn't seen before. ""On the way home it was petrifying – getting in a car was scary. I was just going along with what I was told to do. ""It felt like I was going home with strangers who said they were my mum and dad – my mum was showing me my room they had done up for me for after my surgery – but none of it looked like it belonged to me. ""I remember looking at my clothes and thinking who would wear this?"" Weronika, from Prestonpans near Edinburgh, said she knew it was ok to be there, but said her whole personality, and her family relationships, changed. She said: ""They never lost that connection with me, but even now, I don't think my relationship is as close as they would want it – I am more isolated and have been my own person since the surgery. ""My parents kept showing me photo albums – and that really annoyed me - they were talking and laughing about things I did when I was younger but no matter how hard I tried to focus on it, I got nothing. ""I didn't like looking at photos with them because they have emotional attachment to these moments and I don't."" Weronika had to re-learn everything - starting with primary school maths and English. She said it took little time to re-learn as after the lessons were taught, the memory of that seemed to be unlocked - she learned her times tables after going over them twice. Back at high school, she struggled. She did not recognise any of her friends, and, starting over, she gravitated to different people. After a decade of monitoring, Weronika's tumour started to grow slowly, and in March last year, the time had come for action. Weronika - now 25 and about to be married - needed surgery.  And one of her first thoughts was - would she lose her memory again? ""I was devastated,"" she said. ""The surgeon said it was definitely possible that it could happen again. But the tumour was deeper this time and I needed the surgery to improve my life expectancy."" Weronika's treatment is followed in the new series of Surgeons: At the Edge of Life on BBC Two. In the seventh series, which follows surgeons in NHS Lothian, consultant neurosurgeon Imran Liaquat explains the jeopardy of the complicated procedure. The tumour is in the right frontal lobe of Weronika's brain – the area responsible for abstract thought, creativity and concentration.  He will have to identify what is tumour and what is normal tissue then resect - or cut - around it without taking tissue that would affect brain function. Mr Liaquat said: ""Preserving cognitive function is very important - it's the essence of who we are as an individual and that can be disrupted by surgeons. We carry the complications and push the barriers of optimal resection and that does bear on you."" He added that it was imperative to remove as much as possible. ""Evidence for tumours like Weronikas is that we need to remove at least 80-90% of the tumour to add survival advantage."" Assisting in the operating theatre is the man who performed Weronika's original surgery when she was a teenager - consultant neurosurgeon Drahoslav Sokol. Mr Sokol said: ""It's not easy to think about doing another surgery, particularly in the context of her previous complication but we really need to remove her tumour to prevent further problems in the future."" Weronika was terrified she would wake up and not know who her fiance Cameron was. ""The fear was that the last time it happened it changed who I was – what if I don't actually like him?"" But Cameron took it in his stride, making photographic memory books and scrapbooks of their relationship and writing notes and letters to his fiancee. He said: ""She means everything to me - absolutely everything. If she was to lose her memory I would just have to make her fall in love with me all over again and take it from there."" Practically, Weronika wrote down all her banking details and passwords, organised a will, and wrote a letter to her partner for the worst-case scenario. Coming round from her operation, the room held its breath. ""I woke up and everyone was there – this time around I didn't feel like I had a surgery, I felt like I had a nap,"" Weronika said. ""My family were in pieces the whole time.  ""But I was completely aware and I knew exactly what happened. I was able to talk. ""I saw Imran and I remember saying 'I still remember you'."" Weronika is recovering well and married Cameron in December. She is looking forward to a happy life after 100% of the tumour was removed and she is indebted to the two men who made it happen. ""I don't think I could express my gratitude to those two surgeons enough,"" she said. ""This is the second time they have saved my life. ""When you watch it you realise what goes into it and they are like gods  - they are amazing."" The rural holiday retreat near Pickering will be a ""lifeline"" for those affected, they say. Eight-year-old Dulcie Dulcie was diagnosed with a stage four neuroblastoma in 2021. It is the first time in five years that more businesses have been added to the ONS register than removed.

Councillors in Stirling, Renfrewshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Dundee, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Clackmannanshire and Dumfries and Galloway have been meeting to confirm their plans. The biggest agreed percentage increase  of the day came in the smallest authority with Clackmannanshire councillors voting for a 13% rise. Tax rates have been frozen or capped for much of the past two decades but with no such restrictions in place many areas have already seen rises well above the latest inflation rate of 3%. Protesters gathered outside some of the meetings to make known their concerns about potential cuts or spending proposals in their areas. The 13% rise came in Clackmannanshire and was agreed by 11 votes to six. It will see the charge on a band D property go from £1,410.96 to £1,594.38. It could still be surpassed by proposals in Orkney for a 15% rise. Another big increase came in Angus with 11% agreed taking the band D level to £1,461.52 which the council highlighted was still one of the lowest in the country.  Councillors in Aberdeenshire also backed a double-figure percentage rise of 10%. The motion was passed 43 votes to 21 for a rival proposal, with one no vote and takes the annual bill for a band D premises to £1,532.76. The council also approved indicative increases of 8% for both 2026/27, and 2027/28. Argyll and Bute Council agreed a 9.9% rise to £1,625.64 on a band D home. Leader Jim Lynch said: ""Setting the council's budget has been extremely difficult. ""We all use council services every day, but every year council budgets face multi-million pound gaps. ""Decisions made today protect the council services we all rely on from drastic budget cuts, and make investment possible in services that we know matter to local people."" In Renfrewshire, a 9.5% rise was agreed (taking band D properties to £1,572,61 for 2025/26) while Stirling Council voted 12 to 11 for an 8.8% rise (£1,611.87 on band D from £1,481.50). The increase in East Ayrshire was set at 8% (£1,606.44 on band D) with the same percentage rise in South Ayrshire (£1,569.41) and Dundee (£1,605.34). After a lengthy meeting, Dumfries and Galloway councillors voted through spending plans which will see a 9% rise (£1,454.91). Local authorities say the increases are necessary, despite an improved Scottish government settlement, in order to safeguard services after many years of restricted funding. In the current financial year, the government subsidised a nationwide council tax freeze but that ends in April. Other than 2023-24 - when many councils raised rates by about 5% - this is the first time for almost 20 years when a big increase has really been possible. The Scottish government says it is dealing with ""enormous financial pressures"" but is ""investing in, and supporting, local authorities"". It said there was an extra £1bn of funding for councils in its 2025/26 budget - taking the total government grant to about £15bn. Last week, tax rises up to 10% were confirmed for another group of councils with a combined population of about two million.  The latest round means that the majority of the 32 Scottish authorities have now agreed increases which range from 6% in South Lanarkshire up to a proposed 15% in Orkney. Councillors voted for the rise by 11 votes to six at the council's annual budget meeting Bristol City Council has agreed its annual budget, with a 4.99% increase in council tax. Annual bills for an average band D property would be £1,527.09 if the increase is approved.  The new council tax settlement means a band D property will pay £1,528.44. The rise was agreed following a marathon eight-hour debate at County Hall in Trowbridge. Copyright 2025 BBC.

","There is not enough funding available to deliver a number of major infrastructure projects, NI Water has said.   It says the severity of wastewater and drainage development constraints will increase as a result.   The company plans to set out the implications of deferring the Living With Water Plan (LWWP) for Belfast, a £1.9bn programme, next month. The decision means work to upgrade sewage works at Sydenham, Whitehouse and Kinnegar cannot proceed, and works planned at Glenmachan, Greenisland, Carrickfergus and on the sea outfalls will not start.   NI Water says it will begin a programme of maintenance this spring to ""ensure the existing facility operates as effectively as possible"". Last year, the former Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd said an estimated 50% increase in the cost of the plan was not affordable. When LWWP was published in 2015, it set out three objectives:  The lack of wastewater infrastructure has been a longstanding concern of developers who said it was preventing economic growth in the city. Drainage in Belfast was originally designed by Victorian engineers as a combined system, with both sewage and storm water flowing through the same pipes. That was due to the shape of the city, sitting at the bottom of hills at near-sea level. In a statement, NI Water said in late 2024, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) had carried out a review of the LWWP and concluded the original 12-year scale is ""no longer achievable"". It added that the delivery cannot be taken through a formal programme, but will instead need to be carried out by individual partners, such as NI Water, at a ""scale and pace achievable within available budgets"". ""The projects included within the Living With Water in Belfast Plan... are major infrastructure upgrades which require significant and sustained investment over a number of years which is currently not available to NI Water,"" it added. ""Therefore, the projects have been paused indefinitely."" The Department for Economy says the purchase of Timber Quay is key to boosting students in Derry.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwddq1gnzeo,2025-02-27T14:36:57.936Z,David Deans,Extra defence cash could be spent in Wales - minister,"Wales could benefit from plans to boost the UK's spending on defence, a treasury minister has said.","Wales could benefit from plans to boost the UK's spending on defence, a treasury minister has said. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would boost military budgets to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, funded by cuts to foreign aid. On a visit to Airbus, in Newport, Darren Jones said it was a ""great opportunity for the UK economy, including here in Wales"". Finance Secretary for Wales, Mark Drakeford, said he expects a ""share"" of the extra cash to be spent in the country. More than 160 companies supporting the defence sector have operations based in Wales, employing over 20,000 people. Firms include BAE Systems, which has a munitions facility in Monmouthshire, and General Dynamics, which is constructing its AJAX armoured vehicles in Merthyr Tydfil. On Thursday Jones and Drakeford visited Airbus's complex on the outskirts of Newport, which provides security systems for the Ministry of Defence and other private companies. The treasury minister is on a tour of the UK ahead of the spending review - a major announcement which will set out how the government allocates cash for public services. Asked if Wales could benefit from the defence announcement the chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Wales: ""Yes. ""Potentially we are spending more money on defence companies and defence technologies, which is a great opportunity for the UK economy, including here in Wales."" He said there would be ""plenty"" of opportunities for businesses and workers at firms including Airbus. ""We've got the strategic defence review happening at the moment, the spending review will be concluded in June. Once we've done all of that, decided the strategy and the budget we will then just be getting on with spending that money."" Drakeford said: ""Wales already makes a larger proportionate contribution than other parts of the UK to our armed forces.  ""We would certainly be able to see Wales get its share of a very important additional investment."" Asked how he felt about the cuts to international aid to fund the military, the former first minister added: ""There are some very difficult decisions. ""The world is changing around us and not changing in a way where it is easy to see how the pieces will all eventually fall."" He said Sir Keir faced a ""difficult balancing act"". The visit came ahead of meeting between Jones, Drakeford and finance ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland.  On wider UK government spending, Drakeford said he did not find it ""frustrating"" that there was divergence between the two Labour-run governments. Issues include High Speed 2 rail, which the Welsh government says should generate a financial benefit for Wales, and on the devolution of the Crown Estate. ""I think it is natural and normal,"" said Drakeford. ""The responsibility for the Welsh government is to speak up for the things we know to be important here in Wales."" Drakeford said the Welsh government continues ""to have very productive discussions"" on rail, where there is hope the UK government will invest in new stations. Jones said he did not want to be ""relitigating the arguments of a past Conservative government"". But he said there was a ""shared ambition"" over rail investment. The prime minister announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The PM will head to Washington a day after announcing military budgets would rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027. It comes as ministers face pressure to set out defence plans after talks begin to end war in Ukraine. Nato expects 23 of its 32 members to have met the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2024.

A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility. The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb. It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport. The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident. Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or ""wet lease"" provider. A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted. It added: ""We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident.

Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the agreement would come into force on 24 March, after the return of the Ben-my-Chree from dry dock. The Steam Packet said the vessel would undergo port trials and pilotage training before entering service. Danish ferry operator DFDS confirmed the MV Arrow would act as the firm's main freight vessel for the Jersey to Portsmouth route from 28 March. Currently based in Douglas, the MV Arrow can carry 66 14m (46ft) trailers and accommodate 12 passengers. It was bought by the Steam Packet for about £8m in 2022 as a back-up freight vessel for the island's then flagship ferry, the Ben-my-Chree. While it has remained an option for the firm since the arrival of the Manxman in July 2023, under the company's sea services agreement with the Manx government the former flagship ferry must be retained for back-up passenger and freight services. Jersey's government signed a contract with DFDS to operate ferry services in the Channel Islands in December. On March 28 the Danish firm is set to take over the contract from previous provider Condor Ferries, which had also used the MV Arrow to increase freight capacity. It will travel to Teeside for its own dry-docking before its charter with DFDS following the return of the Ben-my-Chree to Manx waters next month. Steam Packet managing director Brian Thomson said the year-long charter would take place while the firm ""future fleet strategy"" was agreed, he said. A committee of Manx politicians recently recommended a new sea services framework should be developed for the Isle of Man by the end of 2025. A spokesman for DFDS said the MV Arrow would be the main freight vessel for the Portsmouth route, alongside its RoPax vessel Stena Vinga, which would provide freight and passenger capacity. The Danish firm said it was making a ""considerable investment"" into its fleet to provide ""modern and comfortable accommodation"" through a refurbishment of the fast ferry Levante Jet, which would service the Jersey to Poole route from April.

Natalia Polischuk, from Kyiv, has shared her thanks on the day that marked three years since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.  Islanders have stepped up to help in many ways, including knitting and sending thousands of baby hats, taking on daring challenges to raise funds, and even driving to and from the borders to deliver vital aid. Marc Laine, who delivered small generators to Ukraine, said he felt compelled to help residents of the country. He said: ""The first time we went [to Ukraine], we took generators and we were welcomed everywhere - there was a lot of comradery. ""I was inspired by everyone we met - if they weren't involved directly in the conflict, they were doing something to help in their own time, there was so much enthusiasm. ""People in Guernsey have been great, Humanitarian Aid Guernsey are fantastic - they have shipped massive donations from the public to Ukraine."" Ms Polischuk said: ""I think the support is important and we are very grateful for the people of Guernsey. ""I do believe that the generators saved numerous lives in the winters - a lot of places was out of electricity for hours.

Leanne Lucas told BBC Panorama how she called 999 as the attacker chased after them. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die,"" she said. A 13-year-old helping to run the class, whom we are calling Sarah, also told the BBC that attacker Axel Rudakubana looked ""possessed"" as he stabbed her. Leanne and Sarah are the first survivors who escaped the room to speak publicly. Ten people were injured and three children were killed in the attack last July. Sarah - who is now 14 and whose identity is protected by a court order - was seriously wounded but managed to lead several other children, including her younger sister, to safety. Sitting alongside her parents, she told us how another ""incredible"" girl, who appeared to be only about 10 years old, was keeping other children calm, telling them: ""Don't worry, your parents are going to be here, everything's going to be OK."" The two survivors of the attack, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop, recounted how they had helped others escape the terrifying violence and how neighbours had rushed to their aid. They also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including messages on social media blaming Leanne for the deaths. Leanne and Sarah both expressed shock at how authorities had missed warning signs about the attacker. ""It's so shocking how much evidence they had on him, how he slipped through the net,"" said Leanne. ""You see the best and the worst at the same time,"" said Sarah, who described seeing ""the evil side of people"" in Rudakubana's violence and ""all the good of all the community coming together as well to help everyone"". With the mammoth Eras tour reaching the UK, the summer of 2024 was Taylor Swift's summer. So when children's yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, organised a workshop themed around the singer, it sold out within a week. Twenty-five little girls, the youngest five years old, signed up for a morning of dancing, yoga, and making friendship bracelets at the Hart Space studio on 29 July. Sarah offered to help the two teachers and took photos at the event. As the session was drawing to a close, Leanne gathered all of the children together. ""We went round the circle and they said how they were feeling and one of the little girls said: 'This is the best day of my life',"" Leanne said. The girl, nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, died later that night. Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were also killed in the attack. Rudakubana, the killer, had arrived by taxi, wearing a bright green hoodie and a medical face mask that covered his mouth. Dashcam footage shows him trying a locked door at the Hart Space before walking through an open doorway and heading up the stairs. Leanne saw the attacker briefly through the window, but she had no idea who he was – or that he posed a threat. The next thing she knew, he was in the room. ""He opened the door and grabbed a child. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't see anything. He then grabbed the next child, and the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'"" Sarah was one of the first to be attacked. ""I saw him stab a child in front of me. And then I saw the knife coming towards me and him coming towards me,"" she said. ""And that's when I saw it go into my arm. And that's when I turned and he must have got my back, but I didn't feel it at the time, because of the adrenaline."" The attacker made his way through the room, before reaching their teacher. ""He moves through the girls by the table and moves next to me,"" Leanne told us, reliving the scene in her mind. ""I just felt something go in my back and my brain just said – he got me."" Leanne suffered five stab wounds – to her spine, her head, her ribs, her lung, and her shoulder blade. Despite this, she managed to get herself and several of the girls out of the room and call the police. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out everyone was going to die,"" she told us, wiping tears from her eyes. ""He was bigger than me. And I just thought: I need to get some help. So we all run towards the door. We were shouting: 'Run!' I called 999 on the landing and I asked for the police."" She said she then saw a flash of green - the attacker's hoodie - ""and I go into panic mode and he's chasing us"". It's clear that more children would have died if the teachers and Sarah hadn't taken the action they did. At Rudakubana's sentencing, the judge said Leanne ""tried to save as many children as she could"" while being attacked, and that ""she did all she could before escaping"". Leanne says: ""The police said we'd all be dead if me and Heidi [fellow organiser] hadn't done what we'd done and that gives nothing for the children who did die... that doesn't take that away."" But like many of those who saved lives that day, she still torments herself. Sarah was left with life-threatening injuries and fractures to two of her spinal vertebrae. ""I remember seeing the girls all like huddling around the stairs,"" she told us calmly. ""So I remember shouting for them to get down and get out. So I was physically pushing them down the stairs to get everyone out. ""I thought that he wasn't going to stop until he killed everyone. I thought that he wanted to kill us all."" Despite her injuries, Sarah managed to lead several other children out of the Hart Space, up the driveway and across the street, where local resident Steve was fixing his garden wall. Sarah told him she had been stabbed and thought she was dying, but Steve reassured her and led the children into his house. ""Everyone was in a blind panic,"" Sarah told us. Steve describes Sarah as ""a hero"". ""She led all them kids away."" He and his wife began taking care of the children. One of the girls who had been stabbed was ""tiny"", Steve recalled, and he could see others were injured too. Meanwhile, James Dixon had heard the screams while working at the garage next door to the Hart Space. ""As a parent, you can tell the difference between a scream of play and a scream of terror,"" he said. ""And this was – nightmares, pain. They were terrified."" A parent was in her car, calling the police, with five or six children in the back. One appeared to be seriously injured. James ran over to another child who had collapsed. ""She asked me: 'Am I going to die?' Which just breaks your heart, but I told her no,"" he said. She was so badly injured he was afraid his reassurance might not be true. ""I focused everything on her to make sure to keep her alive."" James saved the seven-year-old girl's life. Two more workers from the garage, Colin Parry and Julian Medlock, had rushed over to help. They saw Leanne, leaning against a car, ""completely in shock"", said Colin. He asked her if she needed help, but she told him: ""Just look after the girls. Just look after the girls."" ""My brain is going 100 miles an hour but my body won't do anything,"" Leanne recalled. ""And there are people asking me questions and I am saying: 'Go and get the children.' ""I just don't know what else I could have done,"" she said. At the same time, window cleaner Joel Verite had spotted Leanne as he was driving past on his round. He screeched to a halt and saw her point up to the studio, saying that a man was stabbing children up there. Businessman Jon Hayes, who had been working in an adjoining office, had also been stabbed after confronting the attacker. Joel raced inside, shouting as he climbed the stairs. He saw Rudakubana standing at the top of the staircase. ""We locked eyes for a brief second. He's got a knife,"" Joel said. ""My life flashed before my eyes. Who else is with him? Who is going to come behind me?"" Steve had run over from his house, armed with hammers. He met Joel, who had stepped back from the staircase after facing off with the knifeman. ""We had a little chat to ourselves and said, right, are we going to go in and do him or what?"" Steve said. But at that moment, the police arrived. They entered the studio with a Taser, subdued Rudakubana and arrested him. Steve said he saw the police knocking on the locked door of one of the toilets. Inside was Heidi Liddle, Leanne's friend. After helping some of the children escape, she had found an eight-year-old girl hiding in a toilet and had saved her by locking them both inside. It was now noon - the time when the workshop had been due to end - and the street had filled with distraught parents looking for their children. Sarah's dad arrived and saw Joel carrying a child. ""My initial thought was, God - and I just ran for the building,"" he told us. But Steve was telling parents that many of the children were sheltering at his house. There, the door was open and his youngest daughter came out. ""I just gripped tight, ever so hard. She goes, 'I'm fine. I'm fine'."" Still outside the Hart Space studio, Sarah's mum saw ""blood everywhere"". ""There were bloody hands on cars,"" she said. ""When I looked up, I just saw my husband at the end of the street. He was waving me over and I just ran towards him. I just tried not to look at anything or anyone."" Leanne and eight children - including Sarah - were treated for life-threatening injuries. ""I asked someone if I was going to die,"" Leanne said. ""And she didn't say no. She's just said 'you're in the best place'."" Leanne said she heard someone discuss possible paralysis and something about her lungs. Sarah was taken to the same hospital, where her father was told they had had to operate on her lung, which had collapsed from a puncture wound. While Leanne recovered from life-saving surgery, rioting began, first in Southport, then spreading across the UK, following false rumours that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. She said she was targeted on social media by people who blamed her for the children's deaths. ""I just was scared of everybody. And still thinking it was all my fault. If I hadn't arranged the day, if I had never advertised in certain places, if I hadn't used that studio,"" she said. She saw videos of riots taking place on her own street. ""I was like, are they trying to get me?"" Sarah told us ""disinformation"" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story - ""to get my voice and the truth out there to everyone"". Others who acted bravely on that day share Leanne's sense of disbelief and turmoil. ""Those screams haunt me,"" says James, who saved a seven-year-old girl's life. ""I'd think to myself, if I ran a little bit quicker, a little bit braver, took a weapon..."" We first met Leanne in January. She had endured six months of waiting for her attacker to be tried. But on the day his trial was due to begin, Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to three charges of murder and 10 of attempted murder. For Leanne, this was another act of malice. ""I found out he pleaded guilty on the news,"" Leanne recalled. ""I felt so angry. We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say guilty and put every single family, victim, witness - everyone in that position."" For many witnesses in the case, Rudakubana's last-minute guilty plea – however manipulative in its timing – was a relief. Many were dreading the prospect of sitting in a courtroom with their attacker while lawyers pored over the details of the injuries he had inflicted. Sarah, however, wanted her day in court, saying she'd had all the ""stress and anxiety"" without the ""closure"". Rudakubana was sentenced to 52 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed because he was 17 years old when he carried out the attack. Leanne said she wanted to speak out now because, even after the court proceedings, she still did not feel the ""absolute trauma"" of that day had been understood. ""I just feel like I am able to be the voice of people you can't hear who are involved in the story,"" she said. On the day her attacker was sentenced, Leanne spoke about the survivor's guilt she lives with. ""I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died,"" she told the court. She said she was struggling to trust others and trying to see the goodness in the world. ""For Alice, Elsie, Bebe, Heidi and the surviving girls, I'm surviving for you,"" she said. She told us about treasured moments with each of the girls who died. She described Bebe's ""pure excitement"" at holding a puppy during a puppy yoga session. The day of the attack was the first time Leanne had met Alice, and the ""beautiful smile"" of this ""confident ballerina"" left an impression. And she recalled Elsie's enthusiasm for the weekly reading and writing lessons they had together. It is clear that their memory is what keeps her going. ""These children represent goodness, I think. Just pure goodness,"" she told us. ""Happiness. How genuine they were. Positive. The love of life and just making the best out of every single moment. That's how I remember them.""

In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Jason Knauf, formerly the chief executive of William and Kate's Royal Foundation, said: ""It was awful, absolutely awful. It's the lowest I've ever seen him. ""Within a couple of weeks, if you're Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer. I couldn't believe it."" Both the King and the Princess of Wales were treated for cancer last year. Kate is now in remission and Charles is having ongoing treatment. Mr Knauf, 43, stepped down from his position at the end of 2021. Catherine's diagnosis was made public in March last year, and Mr Knauf said: ""The problem was that all this crazy conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. 'Was she really ill?'. ""But they didn't want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn't told the children and they were still working through how to tell the children."" Speaking to reporters last year at the end of his visit to South Africa, Prince William,  42, talked about how he has coped after both his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer, describing the past year as the ""hardest year"" of his life. ""It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,"" he said after being asked how his year has been after a difficult year for the Royal Family."" Mr Knauf also previously worked for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In October 2018, while working for the couple as their communications secretary, Mr Knauf made a bullying complaint against Meghan. He wrote of his concerns to William's then private secretary in an email, in an apparent attempt to force Buckingham Palace to protect staff. The duchess's legal team strenuously denied the allegation. Discussing William's relationship with Harry, Mr Knauf said: ""It's very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye, but he's chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same. ""But I will say, of course, it's been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them. ""I worked really closely with the two of them and we had lots of great times."" Mr Knauf has previously expressed regret in not giving evidence in the Duchess of Sussex's High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal.

The Jersey-based detective series originally ran on BBC One from 1981 to 1991 and starred John Nettles. Toby Whithouse, born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said he had tried to make the show more ""labyrinth"" and wanted to ""test and challenge"" the character of Jim. Set to premiere on 27 February, the new series stars Damien Molony, alongside Zoë Wanamaker and Philip Glenister. The show followed a maverick detective and recovering alcoholic adept at solving complex crimes.  Nettles became a household name due to its success and said he was offered a cameo role but turned it down. Mr Whithouse, whose previous work includes Doctor Who, wanted ""to stay true"" to the programme's roots while offering something new. He said: ""I absolutely wanted to do something that was more complex and more labyrinth and also allowed us to then to develop Jim as a character and to test and challenge him. ""So fans of the original will go away feeling like the show has been respected, and new people, who have come with no baggage or expectations, still really enjoy it."" He told BBC Essex the writing process was far from easy as it was unlike anything he had written before. ""I don't really tend to do police procedure shows, I do more high-concept genres. ""I started to have an idea for the main character and how I would write him and reinvent him. ""In the original show, Jim Bergerac was a recovering alcoholic, which is something that I really wanted to use but we've taken it in a slightly different, more realistic direction."" One of the key changes in the modern version is there will be one story per series instead of one story per week. Bergerac is available on U and U&DRAMA from 27 February.

Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer in Scotland a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police said it had now arrested two men, in their 40s and 50s, as well as a woman in her 40s on suspicion of murder. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Police are still searching an address in the Coronation Street area which is a location Mr Clive is known to have visited on the evening he went missing. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were ""still in limbo"" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said: ""We are doing everything we can to provide Scott's family with the answers they deserve. ""We still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community."" He said: ""I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott's movements that night, to come forward.

The authorities will be allowed to use Treasury loans or cash from selling assets to cover day-to-day spending, which they are normally banned from doing. The figure is up from 19 that requested such flexibility this year, further underscoring the continued financial fragility of the sector. Ministers will, however, encourage councils not to sell off ""community and heritage assets"" to help meet current spending pressures. It remains to be seen what this means in practice, with the government leaving it to authorities to decide which assets meet this definition.  Councils in England will have £69.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year. But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years. On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective £1.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic. Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions. They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year. Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton. Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022. The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs. Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online. They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment. The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in ""partnership - not punishment"". The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending. London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a ""short-term measure"" that ""leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about"".  The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing. Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing. They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally. They have promised the new formula will take into account the ""impact of rurality"" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Conservative-run councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being unfairly funded. The rise was agreed following a marathon eight-hour debate at County Hall in Trowbridge. Andrew Jefferies says he is ""passing on the baton"" as the local authority works on devolution plan.  The county council wants all services in Suffolk to be provided by one unitary authority.  Ashley Baxter, leader of South Kesteven District Council, suggests merging with Rutland.

The wooden seat made in tribute to Warrington man Bill Batcock was pulled into the Irish Sea off Anglesey in December, before travelling 80 miles (130km) and resurfacing on the Cumbrian coast. It was stumbled upon by members of a local Facebook group who tracked down the man's daughter, Helen Wharton, to tell her the bench had been found. ""Dad was such an adventurer, to think he's made a break for it to go on another adventure, it just makes me smile really,"" she said. Ms Wharton said she and her family had ""no idea"" the bench had gone missing during Storm Darragh in December.  She said she was shocked to receive a message on social media with an image of the bench wedged between sand dunes on Drigg beach near Seascale, Cumbria, asking: ""Is this yours?"" ""I couldn't believe it, it was all so strange,"" said Ms Wharton, who lives in Padgate, Warrington. The bench was erected on some exposed headland at Bull Bay on Anglesey to commemorate Mr Batcock, a lover of the Welsh coast and mountains, who died of leukaemia in 2018. He asked for the bench to be placed there ""as he wanted to look out across the sea, across the coast and mountains, towards home"", she said.  Words from one of his poems had been inscribed on a plaque on the bench, which read: ""For me, it has to be the sea."" Ms Wharton told BBC Radio Manchester the message was now ""quite ironic"" given the remarkable journey of the bench. She said the campaign to return the bench was ""really lovely"", adding the words on the plaque had intrigued local people. Megan O'Gorman, who runs the local Facebook group in which a member messaged to say they had found the bench, said she was determined to track down the family.  ""I thought right, who is this person, where has this bench travelled from,"" she said. Ms Wharton said: ""It's just typical if you think of my dad, nothing would tie him down.""

A 63-year-old man was arrested in the Stobswell area of Dundee shortly after 07:15 following a raid by specialist officers. Four hours later, a 23-year-old woman was arrested after officers raided a flat in the Hilltown. A 26-year-old man has also been arrested by police in the West Midlands following simultaneous raids in Birmingham and Wolverhampton.     Police officers remain at both properties following the arrests, which were made as the result of intelligence gathered as part of the inquiry. County lines is where drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are moved across the country - the 'county line' itself is a mobile phone number where orders are placed for the drugs. Vulnerable adults and children are often used to sell the drugs, with some people moved from their local area to another part of the country to sell drugs, often to pay off a debt. The Dundee raids were carried out as part of Operation Spignel, a joint operation with police in the West Midlands. Dundee-based Det Insp Alan Swanston from Police Scotland said: ""We've identified a serious organised crime group that are operating out of the West Midlands area and drug dealing in Dundee. ""Specialist officers will also develop and assess the intelligence and build a picture of what the group looks like and where they're located."" Specialist resources are also being made available for the operation, including cybercrime officers. Det Insp Swanston said: ""The arrests will allow us to conduct interviews, examine any phones or devices that have been obtained and also be able to go through the addresses with a fine toothcomb to identify if there is evidence that would back up the intelligence.""

Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012. In its report the organisation said there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders. A government spokesperson called the findings ""extremely concerning"" and said it would ""seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs"". A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group. The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago. The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace. For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said. Tell Mama said that shift reflected ""the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities"". Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter. Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK. Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders. Tell Mama said that there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" since both the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and the 2024 riots sparked by the Southport murders. Iman Atta, the group's director, called for coordinated action by the government and said: ""As anti-Muslim hate continues to be felt by a greater number of British Muslims, both at a street and online level, our work and support for victims of anti-Muslim hate is needed now more than ever."" The public must ""stand together against hatred and extremism"", she said, and urged those in positions of influence to ""consider how their language risks stereotyping communities and how it unduly influences discussions online and offline"". In response to the findings, the government said that ""attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society"". A spokesperson added: ""We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms."" Hamas took 251 people hostage in the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Around 59 hostages taken during 7 October attacks are still believed to be in Gaza. It was the last exchange of the Gaza ceasefire deal's first phase, leaving questions over what happens next. The delayed release of 600 Palestinian prisoners will reportedly go ahead when Hamas returns four Israeli hostages' bodies. Aid agencies say it is the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in decades. Copyright 2025 BBC.

The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity. ""On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office,"" Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding ""no checks"" had been made. It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade. Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022. A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim. He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks. It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months. As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police.  The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with £1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created. Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was ""better than nothing"", adding there needed to be more accountability for ""people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked"". ""All I can ever do is reflect on my brother's case, and on the day of my brother's murder, the murderer, he didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office, and the fact that he was under-age, so no checks were performed."" She said: ""So I really do think that these, these measures can make a difference, and they will make a difference because it will make it harder."" She described Ronan as the ""light of our life, the best brother anyone could ask for"". Since her son's death, Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, has campaigned for fundamental changes to the law to make it harder for people to sell and buy knives. ""The online sale of bladed articles played a crucial role in this tragedy. A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people. I knew we could not go on like this."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Kanda said she ""absolutely"" believed her son would not have died if the new legislation had been in place at the time of his death in 2022.  ""The murderers would not have been able to get the weapons they were able to get so easily. Nobody was able to stop them, and they were just 16,"" she said. On the new law she said: ""Out of tragedy comes a light. The light we all need."" However, she stressed ""there's so much more we can do"" when tackling the root causes of knife crime. Introduced as part of the government's Crime and Policing Bill in the spring, the rules are in response to a review by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) into the online sale of knives. The changes will also see: Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said ""nothing is off the table"" in regards to knife crime as she described it as ""absolutely disgraceful"" that retailers were selling knives to under 18s. Speaking about Ronan's death on the Today programme she said: ""There was no check that day when the ninja sword, the 20-inch ninja sword was collected at the post office - nobody checked it."" She paid tribute to his family, who she described as at the ""forefront"" of bringing the bill forward and said the new rules would acknowledge the ""problem"" of supply of weapons, rather than just possession, with ""proper sentencing"". The Home Office said the new measures would significantly tighten the law, which until now has been less stringent than the legislation covering the sale of alcohol, tobacco, fireworks or even scratch cards. ""It is horrifying how easy it is for young people to get hold of knives online,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""Even though children's lives are being lost, and families and communities are left devastated as a result."" Commander Stephen Clayman, who led the NPCC review into online knife sales, said: ""Bizarrely it is harder to buy paracetamol in some respects than it is to buy a knife - that can't be right.  ""We want to make retailers more responsible for what they are selling."" The recommendations also require social media companies to be more accountable for the ""thousands of knives"" that Cdr Clayman said were being sold on platforms. ""They are being quite clever about it in the way they don't overtly sell. But they show all the knives and encourage people to move to a different [online] platform to make the transaction. ""If they are selling knives and we can prove it, we will take legal action and ask for the content to be removed."" The measures are aimed at stopping sellers like Stefan Petrescu from Southampton. He used Instagram to sell hundreds of knives. Police found receipts which revealed that Petrescu had bulk-bought more than £3,000-worth of knives, which he had then sold online. Messages from Petrescu's seized phone showed the use of social media platforms to market the knives, with buyers saying they wanted  to ""shank"" (stab) or harm others. In one video, he wears a black balaclava-style mask and gloves while handling knives, advertising his stock of serrated machetes, knuckle dusters and other blades while drill music plays in the background - including the song ""Ready for War"". In October 2024, Petrescu was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to knife-related offences. The home secretary has said the government is on a ""mission"" to halve knife crime over the next 10 years. There were 262 murders involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to March 2024, according to the Ben Kinsella Trust. Fifty-seven of those killed were under 25.

In evidence provided to the BBC, the National Cancer Audit Collaborating Centre (NatCan) highlighted particular problems with prostate, kidney and colon cancers. The expert group said it had found significant variation between hospitals and warned the problems accessing nationally-recommended treatments were putting lives at risk. It carries out audits across nine major cancers - responsible for 80% of cases - and has found shortfalls across a range of different cancer types and stages. Figures shared with the BBC show: NatCan said while a minority of patients would be choosing not to have treatment themselves and others may not be well enough, that could not fully explain the scale of the shortfall or variation between hospitals. Governments in both nations say improving services is a key priority and England is in the process of drawing up a new cancer strategy, which ministers say will revolutionise services. Ian Pattison's case highlights the value of getting the right treatment. He was diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer in 2020, at the age of 65. It had started spreading to nearby organs and he was offered the nationally-recommended treatment of hormone therapy and radiotherapy for his particular type of cancer. He said the treatment was brutal but, now aged 70, his cancer is in remission and he  is enjoying life. Mr Pattison, from Durham, said: ""I was lucky that I live close to a specialist cancer centre in Newcastle where I could get the best treatment. ""It was hard going through it all and coping with the side effects but I am so thankful I got the treatment. ""I feel fit and well. I love walking, spending time with my family and looking after the grandchildren."" But Prof Ajay Aggarwal, clinical director at NatCan, which is run by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) for NHS England and the Welsh government, said it was concerning so many patients were not getting the recommended treatment, adding that the variation was hard to understand. ""We need to do better,"" he said. ""With cancer, we often hear people talking about what the next breakthrough is but, the fact remains, using what we have better could make a huge difference. It would extend and save lives."" Prof Aggarwal said there were likely to be several reasons for the problems and variation, including some services unfairly assuming older patients could not cope with treatment, as well as problems with staffing and capacity. He said there was evidence of smaller hospitals not always referring patients on to specialist centres where they can get treatment but added that even some of the big centres were coming up short for some cancers. But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better. RCS president Tim Mitchell echoed the concerns, saying: ""The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out.  ""At worst, this may mean some patients are needlessly dying or in unnecessary pain.""   And cancer charities said tacking the failings was arguably more important than reducing waiting times. Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said the findings were ""quite staggering"", adding that tackling the variation should be the ""number one priority"" in the forthcoming national cancer strategy. ""Getting the best care to give you the greatest chance of survival should not come down to which hospital you attend or where you live in the country,"" she said. Ms Byrne said patients should get the right care for their particular type of cancer, no matter where they are.  ""We are concerned that people from deprived, rural or ethnically diverse communities could be losing out in particular,"" she said. Amy Rylance, from Prostate Cancer UK, said patients were effectively being denied their ""best chance of a cure"", adding: ""This needs to change now."" NHS England cancer director Prof Peter Johnson said: ""We know that patients' experience of cancer treatment does vary – and we are working hard to address this."" And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Patients should be able to access the cancer care they need regardless of where they live and we are committed to addressing health inequalities as we rebuild the NHS."" A new cancer strategy is expected to be published in the second half of the year, which Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said will revolutionise services. A Welsh government spokeswoman said it was working with the NHS to ""plan, deliver, recover and improve cancer services"". She said the audit highlighted areas where further work was needed.

Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was ""completely wrong"". Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: ""It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration"". But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were ""unacceptable"" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges. A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had ""made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy."" Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an ""all-time high"" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work. The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.  Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood. Badenoch said: ""A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.  ""This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?"" The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.  Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws. The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity. Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.  This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives. Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: ""Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. ""She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework."" He went on: ""It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case."" The prime minister has not specified what the ""legal loophole"" is that he wants to close.  Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.  They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open ""floodgates"". The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians. Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that ""both the question and the answer were unacceptable"". ""It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,"" she said. ""Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process."" She also said MPs, ""just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law"". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices. Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said ""politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament"" - and that such debate ""doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary"". ""This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,"" she said in a statement on X. A government spokesperson said: ""Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing"".  ""As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,"" the statement added.  Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was ""not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs"". ""Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,"" she told reporters. ""If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate."" ""It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,"" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are ""public servants acting independently"" and that, ""frankly, judges deserve better"".

Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post. The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title. If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range.

Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8977l253lo,2025-02-18T10:43:09.077Z,Dominic Casciani,"'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review","Successive governments trying to look ""tough on crime"" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.","Successive governments trying to look ""tough on crime"" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests. The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending. The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were ""knee-jerk"" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.  Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026. ""It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,"" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.  England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.  Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high. The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.  It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring. The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built. Mr Gauke said: ""Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse. ""For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system."" He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, ""prison is not the only form of punishment"". Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population. In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes. As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place. Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people. ""Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,"" it reads.  Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen ""something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most"".  ""As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,"" he added.  ""We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive."" The first of up to 390 prisoners are being freed early in an attempt to ease overcrowding in jails. The replacement HMP Glasgow will open in 2028, three years later than originally planned. The closure of the jail is costing the Devon economy millions of pounds, business leaders say. Winchester Prison was described as ""unsafe"" after a visit by HM Inspectorate of Prisons in October.

It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis. The royals drew the portraits as ""a moment of connection"" to ""spend time looking at and focusing on one another"" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added. The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us. The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions. The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis. Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university. Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day. These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account. A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte. The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte. The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings. The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills. ""These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us,"" said the message on social media, alongside the pictures. ""Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative,"" the post continued.

National Lottery operator Allwyn said the lucky ticket-holder came forward over the weekend to claim their prize of £65,341,620.50. The operator added that Saturday's £7.4 million Lotto jackpot had also been claimed by a single ticket-holder. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: ""It's been an astonishing weekend of millionaire-making, which promises to keep me and my team very busy.""

Fourteen UK players also netted £1 million each in Friday evening's EuroMillions UK  Millionaire Maker draw. Mr Carter said on Monday that seven of those winners are still yet to claim their prize. ""We're asking everyone to check their tickets and we're very much looking forward to meeting all the lucky winners soon,"" he added. Friday's ticket-holder is the second UK EuroMillions jackpot winner of 2025. Earlier this month, one anonymous ticket-holder scooped a prize of more than £83.4m after it was left unclaimed for 13 days. Winners must claim their prize within 180 days of the draw.

Fresh guidance states anyone entering the UK illegally having made the dangerous English Channel crossing - on a small boat or hiding in a vehicle, for example - will be refused citizenship. Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, and nine Church of England bishops are among 147 signatories of a letter, seen by the BBC, to the home secretary urging her to rethink the policy. They wrote that the government must instead focus on ensuring refugees ""are welcomed and integrated into British life"". The Home Office says the government has merely strengthened rules that were already in place on who could obtain citizenship. The letter argues that citizenship is ""not just a legal status"" but ""a tangible fulfilment of the promise of safety, dignity, and opportunity"".  ""When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come."" Referring to a riot at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham last August, it says that part of the response to that violence ""should be on creating integrated communities"". It went on: ""Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust. ""It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits 'us vs them' and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets."" As well as Ms McAnea of Unison - Labour's most generous union backer in the 2024 general election campaign, donating £1.49m - other signatories include the bishops of Chelmsford, Leicester, Gloucester and Dover.  The chief executives of the Refugee Council and Refugee Action have also signed it, alongside Islamic Relief UK and other faith leaders, including rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors.  The government's new policy means anyone applying for citizenship from 10 February, having previously entered the UK illegally will be refused regardless of how long ago they arrived. Previously, refugees who arrived via irregular routes would have to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship.  It has also been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. ""The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused."" The number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has led the government to promise action. Councillor Dave Geddis says the concern comes from a ""lack of communication"". Unison warns plans to close three day centres could cost West Berkshire Council more in the long-term. Refugees are told to pack up tents from Manchester city centre after the council took legal action. Go Back To Where You Came From saw six Brits follow routes taken by refugees to reach the UK.

The pools have been the subject of debate  since the only remaining diving board on the site was deemed unsafe by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Following protests, the removal of the diving platform has been delayed by four weeks to give the States time to ""consider the issues"". Patsy Self said she had been using the diving board since she was around 10 or 11 years old, during the 1950s. ""I think it's a shame really, because it's part of Guernsey history and the diving boards have been there...all through our childhood,"" she said. Mrs Self added: ""Talking to families on Sunday morning they were quite sad to see what was left of it going."" The  La Valette Bathing Pools were once famous for diving competitions, with the Guernsey Swimming Club (GSC) setting up high-diving boards at the Ladies' Pool in 1925. But the boards started being removed in the 1970s and all that remains is one low board. The charity Vive La Vallette, which was formed in 2019 to regenerate the facilities at the pools, said it was ""disappointed"" the remaining diving board had been set to be removed without further consultation. It said the bathing pools were Victorian-era intertidal structures. ""The pools are filled by the sea twice a day at the higher tides and, as the tides drop, they provide a calm swimming area for the public to enjoy,"" a spokesperson said. Margaret Jones, who is also a swimmer and a childhood friend of Mrs Self, said she was uncertain about the changes.  She said: ""I don't think change is always for the best. If it is for the best, then it's a good thing.  ""But I think a lot of the time it's change for change sake, and that's probably what's led to the demise.. of the diving boards. ""They're taking away something and not replacing it with an alternative... why not improve it and let people use it?"" she said. Jo Norman, who began volunteering at the GSC in 1976, said La Vallette was ""a special place"" for her.  She said: ""I remember swimming there as a child and my children learnt to swim down there too with the Guernsey Swimming Club.  ""We took part in the floodlit galas, where the community would come together to join in and watch the incredible fire dives from the high boards."" Ms Norman said memories would remain at the pools forever. ""There was always such a great atmosphere down at the pools and I believe it still remains at the heart of swimming in Guernsey,"" she said. The GSC said the Vallette pools were a hotspot for its events and competitions during the 1960s and 1970s. It added that its centenary year and 125th anniversary were held at the pools as well as the ""occasional swim session"" and annual polar bear swim. Barbara Quevâtre, whose late husband Hayward was a diver at the pools, said she was worried about how young people would find the changes. She said her husband went to the pools to practise on the diving board ""every lunch hour"" before most of the boards were removed in 1989. ""When they came down...he was devastated, so he didn't go down there anymore,"" she said. Mrs Quevâtre added: ""It changed his life altogether really.""  She said her husband was ""older"" when he started diving - and said he was ""too tall to make a neat diver.""  Mrs Quevâtre said it would be ""a shame"" if the  remaining diving board was completely removed. ""There's a community down there. It hasn't been the same since the diving stages came down."" ""With the diving stages taken down as well...it's not the same, you've got your winter swimmers, your all-round swimmers...but there's not the sense of a community somehow,"" she added. Mrs Quevâtre said the pools had ""lost their charm"" since the removal of the diving stages.  ""It's very nice to have wheelchair access and all the rest of it, but for me it's lost its well, charm I suppose. ""It's lost its sort of nature. To me, it's not the same in Guernsey as it was, and various areas around the coast to me have changed sufficiently that Guernsey isn't Guernsey anymore for me.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq0x30kkldo,2025-02-15T18:24:35.961Z,George Sandeman,"UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, says Lammy","The UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an ""existential question"" even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, David Lammy has said.","The UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an ""existential question"" even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary told the Munich Security Conference ""Putin will not go away"", and that, while it was positive 23 Nato countries were now spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence, ""we all know we have to go upward"". He said the UK was ""absolutely"" committed to spending 2.5% and would set out a ""pathway"" to achieving that goal in a few months' time. Lammy's comments come after US Vice-President JD Vance told the conference on Friday that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"". In his address, Vance said it was his belief the greatest threat facing Europe was not from Russia or China but ""from within"". He said many European governments, including the UK's, had retreated from their values and ignored issues such as migration and free speech. Speaking on Saturday during a panel discussion on European security, Lammy told the audience that successive US presidents had asked Nato members to increase defence spending and emphasised the importance of continued support for Ukraine. Appearing alongside his counterparts from France, Germany and Poland, Lammy said: ""There is a question for Europe. If we look at GDP combined, it's about 0.01% that we are spending on that fight for Ukraine.  ""We know this is the frontline, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe. We know too that even when we get to a negotiated peace, Putin will not go away. So this is an existential question for Europe."" He said that he understood why the US was now focusing on its security interests in the Pacific, where China is a major power both economically and militarily.  ""People have given the impression that the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are tied just at this moment - it was tied in the Second World War,"" he said, mentioning that 30,000 British soldiers died in the region during that conflict. ""We recognise that pacing threat as the United States bears down on that issue. So of course Europe has to do more."" Earlier, in an article for The Telegraph, Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey said the West had done too little in the past when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014. They said the UK and Europe now needed to ""do more together"" to ""share the burden"" of security across the continent.  The UK had committed an additional £150m towards military aid for Ukraine as well as new sanctions on people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he ""only responds to strength"", they added. Meeting Vance on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted ""security guarantees"" ahead of planned peace talks between the US and Russia. US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Putin on Wednesday and agreed to ""work together, very closely"" to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It has been nearly three years since Russia invaded. Zelensky has proposed what he described as an ""army of Europe"" to secure the continent. He told the conference on Saturday: ""As we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the armed forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans, and decisions about Europe are made in Europe."" He added: ""Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen different ones."" Asked during the panel discussion about the security guarantees being considered, Lammy said a long-term military and financial partnership might be best. ""The UK has just signed a 100-year partnership with Ukraine and I would encourage Donald Trump, and the Ukrainians, to look very carefully at a deepening partnership over the next generations,"" he said. ""Why? Because the best deal, and the best security guarantee, is binding US industry, business and defence capability into their future.  ""That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention and that is what is attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal."" Among the other possible measures mentioned by experts is the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine. Lord Dannatt, who was head of the British Army from 2006 to 2009, estimated that around 100,000 soldiers would be needed for such a mission and that the UK might need to contribute 40,000 of them. ""We just haven't got that number available,"" he told the BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster. ""Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing."" Sir Richard Shirreff, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, told Radio 4's Today programme that ""100,000 [troops] is probably the minimum"". Asked about calls to significantly increase defence spending, he said: ""This is a defining moment for European militaries [and] European governments"". President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US has given over $300bn to Ukraine, but he is incorrect. The reports of a new deployment come after Pyongyang was said to be suffering heavy losses in the Kursk region.  President Trump says the pair are poised to sign a ""very big agreement"", which Zelensky described as a ""framework"". A Ukrainian official says Kyiv has agreed to the terms of a deal which would give the US access to mineral deposits. David Lammy says the UK ""a shared military and intelligence interest"" with the US in the territory. Copyright 2025 BBC.

She said EasyJet's schedule changes were not based on how the the facility was ""managed or run but was rather a ""business decision"" made by the firm, she said. The airline is set to reduce flights between Ronaldsway Airport and Liverpool and Manchester between April and November following a fall in demand. Michelle Haywood said while she was ""comforted"" the carrier would continue to serve the island, she ""understands the frustrations"" of those whose travel plans had been disrupted. An EasyJet spokesman previously said the airline continually reviewed its schedule across its network ""to align with demand"". While its flights to London Gatwick and Bristol have been unaffected, in April the airline will run up to 12 flights a week to and from Manchester, and 10 flights a week to and from Liverpool. Haywood said there had been a ""real difference"" in the types of flights the airline wanted to provide, and ""by adding 33 new routes from the UK into Europe they need the planes to be elsewhere"". ""Some of the take-off and land journeys have been a casualty of that change, its easyJet's decision to make, its unfortunate the Isle of Man is losing out slightly,"" she said. But the minister said the Strategic Air Services Policy, which was recently passed by Tynwald and maintains an open skies policy, allowed the island ""freedom to negotiate with airlines to explore new route"". ""Work is ongoing with the airport and the Department for Enterprise over improving routes and getting increased connections into other destinations,"" she added.

Apart from being an insight into what everyone really wants, even among Californian health fadsters, it was a chance to send a message to her husband, who is attending the Invictus Games in Canada. ""Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine,"" Meghan wrote on social media, saying she was ""beyond proud"" of his sports event for disabled and wounded veterans. The Prince and Princess of Wales also put out their own social media message, with a single heart emoji and a picture of the couple holding hands and kissing. The picture of Prince William and Catherine was particularly poignant, as a still from the video that she had issued last September alongside an announcement that she had completed her cancer treatment. It's a slightly retro-image, with autumn colours and Enid Blyton shorts, taken in woodland in Norfolk and showing Prince William kissing Catherine. Prince Harry and Meghan are also kissing in their picture on social media, in a black and white photo of the couple behind what could be the two dishes linking the US and the UK, with a burger and fries and fish and chips a culinary marker of their own transatlantic ""special relationship"". Meghan added the tag #lovewins to her Valentine's message and signed off ""As ever, M."" There's also another important part of the romantic mood, with what looks like a big glass of red wine.

It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below.","It's the early hours of the morning in March 2024 and Ben is woken by shouting and swearing. It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below. An hour before, Ben could see and hear threats on the screen of his doorbell camera. It's been rung multiple times and he says he's barely slept. This is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before. He says he's been ""abused"" and ""physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house"". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear. Ben bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after. As well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night. He says the disruption even affected his ability to work. ""Because I was so sleep-deprived, I was getting to work quite late. I couldn't focus on my job. Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job."" Ben eventually got a new job but says he's been left feeling ""really helpless"" and says the whole experience has had a detrimental impact on his mental health. Emma adds that she too has been left ""terrified"". ""We just feel trapped,"" she says. Ben and Emma are not alone in experiencing anti-social behaviour. According to the latest official data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 36% of people experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour last year, up from 34% the previous year. Ben is a leaseholder in a council-owned block and says many of his complaints to Wandsworth Council went unanswered. He says he feels ignored, despite mentioning concerns about mental health and violent threats. Ben and Emma have called the police to their address more than 20 times and say while local neighbourhood officers have been helpful, they feel failed by the system and ""let down"" by response times when they call 999. In August, an official review panel - made up of police and public officials - found there had ""not been good communication between agencies"" and ""none of the agencies has taken ownership of the case"". Wandsworth council has accepted it ""could have acted more swiftly."" Ben has now complained to the housing ombudsman. Over the last year, across the UK, the Housing Ombudsman has ruled that of the 809 anti-social behaviour cases he has presided over, 67% of social landlords hadn't dealt with the issue to an adequate standard. Richard Blakeway, the Housing Ombudsman, said: ""Anti-social behaviour can cause unimaginable distress to people, have a profound impact on the community, and be complex for landlords to manage."" He added that he repeatedly sees cases where ""failures prolong issues and leaves residents feeling unheard and continuing to suffer"". The BBC showed some of Ben's footage to Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales. ""It shows that the system isn't working, once again, to protect innocent people,"" she says. Baroness Newlove's husband Garry died in hospital after being attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August 2007 by three youths after he went to speak to a gang he believed had been vandalising his wife's car. She says 17 years later, agencies still don't understand the impact anti-social behaviour has on victims. She fears it will take another death for it to be taken more seriously and for it not be treated as ""low-level"" crime. She says her inbox is full of complaints from victims about anti-social behaviour. Baroness Newlove hopes new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill, being drafted this year, will improve protection for victims. In December, Ben's neighbour, Drina Gray, pleaded guilty to charges including harassment and criminal damage and will be sentenced in March. Ben says the anti-social behaviour has continued and Gray has been rearrested multiple times since. She returned to the flat after the first arrest but the BBC understands she is temporarily staying elsewhere as per her bail conditions.  The council says following the court case, it is now seeking possession of the property. But Ben says he has no idea when Gray will be permanently moved. In a statement, Wandsworth Council said it ""takes criminal and anti-social behaviour very seriously, and we work with partners to both support residents and to take the appropriate action against those responsible.  ""This is a complex case where housing officers have been working closely with a number of different agencies, including the Police, to resolve the matter."" A spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""Any form of anti-social behaviour is taken seriously and we work in partnership with local authority colleagues to ensure that issues raised are addressed"". Addressing Ben and Emma's specific case, the spokesperson said the police were working to ""ensure that the offender is brought before the courts when there is evidence to support it"".

It follows months of uncertainty over what schedules will be offered between Guernsey and Jersey by Danish firm DFDS and Brittany Ferries.  Sponsorship director of Guernsey Raiders RFC, Chris Gnapp, said they had taken the ""financial risk"" of chartering a boat for the rugby union team. DFDS previously said it was still finalising its schedule and it had been delayed during a legal challenge over the tender process by rival firm Brittany Ferries. The BBC has contacted both DFDS and Brittany Ferries for comment. Mr Gnapp added: ""We have had to take the financial risk of chartering this boat over because there is simply no other way of getting our training teams over to Jersey to play rugby."" Meanwhile director of Guernsey Netball, Sally Carns, said the lack of certainty about travel had been a ""logistical nightmare"".  Ms Carns said: ""We can't allow any supporters to travel because we booked out all the flights for that day. ""On the Sunday, we have had to charter a plane, which, again, the financial risk of not filling it sits with ourselves as a charity. ""Logistical nightmare is the phrase of the week."" She said questions were being asked and discussions were going to be had.  During the coming summer months, there is expected to be a third ferry service provided by Islands Unlimited, which has said it will offer a daily foot-passenger service. Chad Murray, managing director, said: ""From what we found, there is a strong desire to have consistent, regular travel between the islands."" Mr Murray said teams had been working on the new ferry service for about 18 months.  He said there was demand for services ""that allow long day trips to each of the islands, not only for tourists and visitors, but also for island communities"". Mr Murray added the current owners of the vessel it planned to use were still operating it, so they were negotiating an ""exact date"" of when it would be released.  He said it would be ""unreasonable"" to set the booking system live until they had confirmation on the date, adding he hoped it would be live in two to three weeks.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

Mika, a three-year-old Tibetan Terrier from Guernsey, claimed the hearts of islanders at the Trinity Royal Showground in Jersey on Saturday.  Her success now means she will be placed in the open bitch class at Crufts, regarded as the ""world's greatest dog show"" by organisers.  Mika's shared owner Chrissy Le Moignan said the category ""means she's against the big girls now, so what will be will be."" Mika has attended Crufts each year with this year's show taking place at Birmingham's NEC between 6 and 9 March.  Discussing Mika's temperament, Ms Le Moignan said: ""She loves the show ring, she's an absolute dream.  ""She's a monster outside the show ring but put her in the ring and she knows what to do. She's a real showman and she loves it."" Mika's title-winning performance on Saturday meant she was able to follow in the paw-steps of her half sister, who won the same title two years prior.  Discussing the win, Mika's other shared owner and vice president of Guernsey Kennel Club, Paige Le Moignan, said: ""I'm absolutely ecstatic, we didn't expect it at all in any way, shape or form. ""You should never go into any competition expecting to win it but everyone is there for the same reason, everyone wants to win, and we were absolutely astounded when she won.""

Beth was attacked with a machete by her former partner, a neo-Nazi misogynist who used his MI5 role to coercively control her. We revealed on Wednesday that MI5 gave false evidence to three courts over its handling of the man - a paid informant known only as agent X. MI5 has now issued an ""unreserved apology"" describing what happened as a ""serious error"" - adding it took full responsibility. But speaking for the first time since then, Beth - not her real name - asks: ""Where's my apology?"" She believes she only matters to MI5 because she is ""kicking up a fuss"" by taking a legal case against the service and ""throwing a spotlight on the way that they behave"". ""But otherwise, if I were to just go quietly away, they'd never think about me again,"" she told the BBC. Beth says she would like to see X - a foreign national - to be personally ""held accountable for all the crimes he committed"", and for there to be a review of how he was to go unpunished and start a new life abroad. Beth's legal case claims MI5 breached her human rights by failing to protect her from agent X. She is pursuing a formal complaint at an independent court, called the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). Judges ruled much of the case should be held in secret after MI5 said it does not confirm agent identities - under a principle known as neither confirm nor deny (NCND) - and had not done so with X. Secret IPT sessions would be closed to Beth and her lawyers, and therefore prevent her from knowing what MI5 says in response to her claim. ""It felt completely offensive to be told that my case would have to be held in private and that I wouldn't be privy to any of the information because that's how they operated, as if they're allowed some special licence to completely breach my human rights."" However, I revealed on Wednesday that I had been told by a senior MI5 officer that X was an agent. The disclosure happened when MI5 contacted me to try to stop a BBC story about his extremism. The IPT was one of the three courts to which MI5 gave false evidence, including by stating it had never confirmed X's agent status to me. MI5 first lied in 2022, when the government took me and the BBC to court in an attempt to block us reporting on agent X's wrongdoing - and succeeded in banning us from identifying him. Beth says the false evidence ""proves what MI5 are capable of"". ""[It] feels like all my worst suspicions have been confirmed,"" she adds. ""Everything that I was told by X about them, at the time we were together, has actually been proven to be the case - that they are unscrupulous people who will stop at nothing to achieve what they want."" Beth met agent X on a dating site. But, over time, he became physically, mentally and sexually abusive. After attacking Beth with a machete, in a case that was dropped by prosecutors after police failed to obtain the video of the attack, X left the UK while under police investigation and began work for a foreign intelligence agency. ""What concerns me so much is that, as far as we know, he is a free man,"" says Beth. ""I don't want other women to have to put up with things like this. It's disgusting."" She believes MI5 has a particular type of power that enables it to avoid transparency like other organisations. MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence, which may result in disciplinary action. The senior MI5 corporate witness who gave false evidence says he thought he was telling the truth. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has also announced an independent external review of how MI5 gave false evidence. It is being conducted by Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government's legal service. Beth's case will now head back to the specialist IPT court, which will reconsider the decision to rule that MI5 can refuse to confirm that X was an agent and therefore keep evidence secret from her. Until this is decided, the full case will not be heard. When I was first in contact with Beth, she had recently suffered a breakdown because of X's behaviour towards her. She has come a long way in the years since. The legal process is re-traumatising but necessary, Beth says. ""I've already lost years of my life to X and his abuse - there seems to be no end to it. ""But it seems like it's the only way that I might, potentially, get some sort of reasonable justice."" When asked about the wider implication of her case, Beth says it is ""really important"". She says there is ""so much violence carried out on women by men,"" adding, ""whatever we can do as a society against it needs to be done"". ""I am one of the lucky ones because I've been able to speak about it and I've been listened to and so many don't get listened to.""

New guidance states that anyone who enters the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey, which could be via boat, but also by means such as hiding in a vehicle, will normally be refused citizenship, regardless of the time that has passed.  In a statement, the Home Office said the strengthened measures made it clear that anyone who entered the UK illegally would face having a British citizenship application refused. But the change has been condemned by the Refugee Council and some Labour MPs - including Stella Creasy who said the change ""meant refugees would forever remain second class citizens"". Changes, first disclosed by the Free Movement blog, were introduced to guidance for visa and immigration staff on Monday. The changes mean that anyone deemed to have entered the country illegally - including those already here - will not be able to apply for citizenship. Described as a ""clarification"" to case worker guidance when assessing if a claimant is of ""good character', it says: ""Any person applying for citizenship from 10 February 2025, who previously entered the UK illegally will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place."" Another new entry to the same guidance says: ""A person who applies for citizenship from 10 February 2025 who has previously arrived without a required valid entry clearance or electronic travel authorisation, having made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship. ""A dangerous journey includes, but is not limited to, travelling by small boat or concealed in a vehicle or other conveyance."" Previously, refugees who had arrived by irregular routes would need to wait 10 years before being considered.  Under UK law, it is now an offence to enter the country without permission. This is despite the UK being signatory to international law treaties, such as the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which state that asylum seekers and refugees should not be penalised for illegal entry.  The government's new border security bill, which scraps the Conservatives' Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against people smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons on Monday.  The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists, and creates a new crime of endangering another person during an illegal crossing in the Channel. The Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants, as part of a UK-wide crackdown on illegal working earlier this week. Commenting on the new guidance for refugees, Labour MP Creasy said she worked with a young man who after fleeing Syria and gaining a degree is now ""contributing to our society, and has now got British citizenship"". ""This process would deny that,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Creasy also claimed the change to rules on citizenship for refugees would ""deny"" Paddington Bear from obtaining a British passport. The fictional character famously arrived in the UK by stowing away on a boat from his home in Peru.  ""Essentially it would deny, well, frankly, Paddington,"" Creasy said. ""Paddington did the same thing. He came by an irregular route, but we gave him sanctuary but wouldn't give him a passport."" Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, urged the government to ""reflect on the societal and cohesion aspects"" of the policy. He called on ministers to consider ""the impact on children and their right to UK citizenship and the statelessness which would arrive for individuals if their birth country refused to renew or retain their nationality"". ""Surely this Parliament should have a say in such a big change,"" he told the House of Lords. In response, Home Office minister Lord Hanson of Flint said children will be ""considered sympathetically under existing legislation to date"". The Home Office confirmed that the new restrictions will ""likely not apply"" to children, ""given illegal entry is normally considered outside a child's control"". However, each citizenship application will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, it added.  The Refugee Council estimates the guidance will prevent at least 71,000 refugees from obtaining British citizenship. Enver Solomon, CEO of the charity, said the government's move ""flies in the face of reason"". ""The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. ""We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives.  ""We urge ministers to urgently reconsider."" Meanwhile, immigration barrister Colin Yeo argued on social media that it is a ""clear breach of the Refugee Convention"". Although the Conservatives have yet to respond to the government's decision, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC last week that she believes the right to citizenship and permanent residency ""should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK"". Badenoch spoke about her proposals to toughen up citizenship rules by making it more difficult for new immigrants to be able to permanently settle in the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""There are already rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. ""This guidance further strengthens measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.""

A total of 48% of forces found drivers going more than three times the 30mph limit, while 90% had clocked people driving at 60mph. The highest recorded speed on 30mph roads was 122mph in South Yorkshire. For 20mph roads, the top speed was logged by North Wales Police at 88mph. The highest recorded speed on any road was 167mph on a 70mph stretch of the M1 in Leicestershire. The largest difference between the speed recorded and the speed limit was 161mph on a 50mph in Somerset. The data came from Freedom of Information requests the RAC made to 45 police forces relating to the period from January 2023 to the end of August 2024. Forty forces provided data. The 10 highest speeds clocked on 30mph roads were:  RAC road safety spokesperson Rod Dennis said: ""Although this data is a snapshot, it shines a light on the incredibly dangerous actions of a few, that are putting law-abiding road users at serious risk. Thankfully, the police were on hand to catch these drivers."" Chief Constable Jo Shiner, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said choosing to drive above the speed limit amounted to ""reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable"" behaviour.  ""We know that some incidents of going over the speed limit can be genuine mistakes or errors, but the speeds cited here are clearly drivers taking deliberate decisions to travel at excessive speeds, putting everyone at risk,"" she said. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said there were tough penalties in place for drivers who speed.  ""While our roads are among the safest in the world, we are committed to improving road safety, and recently relaunched our Think! campaign with a focus on speeding, particularly on rural roads."" Speed is the biggest factor reported in fatal road collisions, according to government data. In 2023 speed contributed to 888 fatalities, and more than 39,000 collisions of all severities. More than 24,000 vehicles were caught on camera being driven at more than 100mph (161km/h) between 2019 and 2023, police data shows.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25m231n8xo,2025-02-12T14:47:03.049Z,Daniel De Simone,How I exposed MI5's lie about its violent abusive agent,"Spies lie, but they are not meant to get caught.","Spies lie, but they are not meant to get caught. On a wet Friday evening in December, three MI5 lawyers sat in a room at the BBC's headquarters in London. On the other side of the table were the BBC's lawyers and me. No MI5 officers were present, after we refused a request for the meeting to be secret. After exchanging strained smiles, we got down to business - and proved to them that the Security Service had been giving false evidence to the courts. The meeting took place after I told MI5 in November that we were planning to report it had lied and offered it a chance to comment. In response, the Security Service insisted - aggressively so - that it had been entirely honest. What it hadn't realised until the December meeting, was that I had hard evidence to prove its position was false. The revelation of the false evidence matters because it raises serious concerns about how reliable MI5's evidence is in the courts, where assessments from the Security Service are given enormous deference. It also raises fresh doubts about whether MI5 can continue with a core policy of secrecy - after we revealed it was applying it selectively. The organisation's first lie came when the government took the BBC to the High Court in 2022 to block a story about a right-wing extremist working as an MI5 agent - the term for a paid and authorised informant. Former Attorney General Suella Braverman failed to prevent us publishing the story but succeeded in getting an order preventing the man from being identified, having argued he would be in danger. As a result, the man is known publicly only as X. We argued he should be identified so women could be warned about such a predatory and violent man. X had used his MI5 role to coercively control his ex-partner, known publicly by the alias Beth. He was physically and sexually abusive, and was filmed threatening to kill her and then attacking her with a machete. During the legal proceedings, MI5 said it could publicly neither confirm nor deny (NCND) whether X was an agent, in line with its long-standing policy. In public, MI5 emphasises the fundamental role of the NCND policy, which it says it follows in relation to its agents. Any exceptions are said to undermine the secrecy that protects such men and women and to damage national security. But then, during the proceedings, a senior MI5 officer - a deputy director of the organisation and senior counter-terrorism officer, known in court as Witness A - mentioned some phone calls involving me. In a corporate witness statement, Witness A said an MI5 representative had spoken to me at an earlier date. This came after the Security Service became aware the BBC intended to include X in an investigative story. Witness A said that, during the discussions, I said I had suspected X was a state agent, but that MI5 had ""neither confirmed nor denied"" whether this was the case. He did not explain who initiated the discussions - it was MI5. Nor did he say how the Security Service had become aware of the planned BBC story - X had told them. In my own detailed witness statement, I said this account did not correspond with my recollection in various respects. I did not go into further detail, because - without any waiver of legal privilege - I had been advised by lawyers it would not affect the key issues in the dispute, which centred on the claimed risks to X if he were identified by the BBC. The BBC team also only had access to parts of the case - some evidence and hearings were in secret. During one secret part of the proceedings, to which the BBC team and I did not have access, security-cleared lawyers appointed on our behalf were also told by MI5's lawyers that it had maintained its neither confirm nor deny policy in the calls with me. But I knew that what Witness A said about me in his statement was untrue. I knew that MI5 had not abided by NCND. To be honest, I resented its lie. We can also now report that MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC director general Tim Davie, in December 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's planned story about X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, which were served as part of the government's evidence in the 2022 High Court case, record him claiming the intended story was ""inaccurate as well as reckless"". However, the story was accurate. The judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements were true and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. Despite not being allowed to identify X, the High Court ruled we could report the results of our investigation. It showed that X had abused Beth and another former partner, and that he was a dangerous extremist. At about the same time, Beth lodged a formal complaint about her treatment by MI5 with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), an independent court with the power to investigate human rights claims against the Security Service. It was at this court where MI5 would lie again. The IPT often sits in secret without claimants, their legal representatives, journalists or the public present, to consider evidence deemed sensitive for national security reasons. In the case of X, this meant all the information which confirmed he was an MI5 agent. Lawyers for the IPT are meant to represent the interests of claimants in the closed sessions. But Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, who is representing Beth, says the system is inherently problematic. ""You're not entitled to know what's being said about you. There might be things that are being said that you could disprove. You might be being called a liar and you're not entitled to know any of this,"" she says. All Beth would be able to know at the end of the case is whether she had won or lost, and she would never really understand why, Ms Ellis says. Beth asked the tribunal that MI5 drop its policy of neither confirming nor denying. Otherwise, her lawyers argued, most of the case would have to be heard in closed sessions. They said X had already disclosed his role to Beth and used it to coerce her. But lawyers for MI5 argued it would mean the Security Service being forced for the ""first time ever"" to confirm to a third party in legal proceedings whether someone was an agent. Last summer, the IPT ruled against Beth. While it accepted that maintaining NCND had an impact on her right to a fair hearing - because she cannot counter evidence presented in secret - it said the policy ""fundamentally relies upon the absolute consistency of its application"". It added that MI5 had ""gone to extensive lengths throughout these and the BBC proceedings to uphold the NCND policy"". MI5 repeated its false evidence to a third court when Beth sought a judicial review of this IPT ruling. From then, I was determined that the truth about MI5's behaviour had to come out. I had first met Beth when she was very unwell in the aftermath of X's abuse and coercion. I knew how far she had come since then and wanted to do right by her. I began working with a small team of BBC lawyers to develop a strategy. The truth is that, in several calls with me, a senior MI5 officer had departed from the NCND policy by announcing to me that X was an agent and inviting me to meet him. The officer said he had been legally authorised to tell me the information. The calls were part of MI5's attempt to persuade me not to identify X as an extremist as part of our planned investigative story. They came after I had sent X a letter, detailing his involvement in violent extremism and giving him an opportunity to respond. In November last year, after working with the BBC legal team for several months, I wrote to MI5 to say we planned to report that the Security Service had lied to the courts, and that it had departed from NCND during phone calls with me. I did not say how I would prove these claims. At the same time, the BBC lawyers wrote to the office of the new Attorney General, Lord Hermer, to tell them we planned to apply to the court to make public the part of the MI5 witness statement in which false evidence was given. On 25 November, a government lawyer responded on behalf of MI5 to me, saying that MI5 ""stands by the entirety of the account given to the High Court in Witness A's witness statement"". It said that the Security Service's position remains that ""there was no such departure"" from the NCND policy and suggested that MI5's evidence had been ""carefully considered"". I was surprised by this response. MI5 was gambling that I could not prove what I had set out. It was a gamble the Security Service was about to lose. We responded saying that MI5 was invited to a meeting where it could inspect the evidence we would rely on in our court application. We took this unusual step to allow MI5 to consider whether to consent to changing the terms of an injunction put in place at the end of the case against us in 2022. And so it came to that meeting on 13 December, when the three lawyers acting for MI5 came to the BBC's offices at London Broadcasting House to meet me and the BBC legal team. They read and listened to the relevant material, which comprised a handwritten note of a first call from MI5, an email I had sent to the MI5 officer following that call, and an audio recording of a second call the next day. I took the MI5 team through the evidence in chronological order. My impression was that they appeared slightly buoyed when shown a handwritten note, deflated by the email, and defeated when faced with the 40-minute audio recording - as each step revealed our evidence was stronger. My handwritten note showed what the purpose of MI5's call was - to tell me that X was an agent. The MI5 officer who rang me said he had been ""authorised"" to tell me, something which he said would otherwise have been ""illegal"". This information was volunteered to me by MI5, not in response to a query by me about whether X was an agent - which was not something I had asked either to X or to MI5. I had never spoken to the MI5 officer before. He was not a source or a friend. In fact, as I would find, he was seeking to protect X and gave a false impression about the man's risk to women. The officer, who worked closely with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum, characterised X as someone who was informing on extremists for the Security Service, not an extremist himself. The phone request was that we should not go ahead with our proposed story because MI5 said it was untrue. My impression was that MI5 had called assuming I would agree to this request with little further challenge. Instead, during the conversation I took issue with MI5's characterisation of X, whom I regarded - and still regard - as a genuine extremist. I also raised with MI5 the violence, abuse and coercion that X had engaged in within his personal life. I did not say how I knew about these matters, nor name anyone affected by them. Those matters had not been in my letter to X and I think the MI5 officer was surprised when I raised them. I made clear how concerned I was about these matters. I was troubled MI5 was seeking to protect someone I regarded as a danger to women, children and the wider public. The call concluded with me saying I would need to consider what he had requested, including in internal editorial discussions. The MI5 officer told me he was going to make checks based on concerns I had raised about X. He asked that I send him an email summarising the information about the man's personal conduct which I had mentioned during the phone call. The email I sent soon afterwards said: ""As discussed, the male concerned was and is the subject of allegations of violence and fraud involving a British female. The alleged violence extends up to attempted murder. ""He is alleged to have engaged in domestic abuse and sexual violence, expressed paedophilic tendencies, and caused serious mental harm to people in his life."" The ""attempted murder"" referred to the machete incident. At that time, I had been told by Beth about the incident but had not seen the video of it. I would later obtain the video and take investigative steps to corroborate what I had been told, something MI5 could have done had it wanted to. The next day there was a further phone call from the same MI5 officer. I recorded the conversation for note-taking purposes, in accordance with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines, because I wanted a full record of what was said. I also did not trust MI5. In the recorded call, the senior MI5 officer claimed the service ""pretty strongly assess"" that X had not been recently violent. My research would go on to prove this assessment was wholly false and the machete attack had been just the year before. The officer said: ""We do cast serious doubt on the most recent allegations of acts of violence, particularly against that individual."" He emphasised that MI5's assessment was that ""we are of the belief that actually he hasn't been involved in recent acts of violence"", although he qualified that by saying they could ""never categorically say that was definitely the case"". During the call, he also accepted that X was not stable and had been involved in ""lots of… drug gang activity"" previously, ""will have been involved in a bunch of things"", and came ""from a very shady past"", implying he had been violent. Despite all this, MI5 characterised X's relationship with Beth as ""slightly problematic"", suggesting she had ""mental health issues"".  When I wrote to X, I mentioned a vile and alarming online post he had made, about severely sexually exploiting women - using language too offensive to repeat. The MI5 officer claimed that when X had posted this, he had been temporarily de-authorised - meaning he was not at that moment working for MI5. I explained that, based on what I knew of X, the post was what he was really like, demonstrated his propensity for violence against women, and that was the cause of my concern with him. The officer accepted the post ""strays over the line"", but seemed not to understand the obvious logic that, if it had been posted when X was briefly de-authorised, this only demonstrated X's true nature even more. He was a genuinely dangerous misogynist - it was not an act put on for MI5. The MI5 officer seemed to be most fascinated by how we had worked out X's true identity. I found this surprising, given I was talking to MI5, and explained it was basic journalism. During the call I also told the officer that X had been on a dating site under an alias used for his MI5 work. I said that I had already been told that X was an informant, separately to MI5's call. The MI5 officer seemed concerned by this information. However, he also invited me to meet X and learn about his work as an agent. He made this offer twice during the call. I ignored both offers. My impression was that this was a crude attempt to offer me something exciting - a meeting with an MI5 agent - which would make me forget my concerns. I considered it wholly inappropriate given X's misogyny, sadism, paedophilic tendencies, violence and abuse. Five days after the December meeting where we played the recording of the call to the MI5 lawyers, the government wrote to the BBC saying MI5 now took the view its evidence ""may be materially incorrect, and that it is important the position is corrected as soon as possible"". The BBC decided the best way to ensure the court and government had the relevant evidence was to make our application to publish the false testimony. The application included a new witness statement from me. We filed it on Christmas Eve. MI5 reversed their position entirely in response. In a new witness statement submitted to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he ""sincerely"" apologised for giving incorrect evidence. He said the false information ""reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given"". He also said that ""it is now apparent to me that MI5 did, in fact, depart from NCND during the discussions"". At this time, he has not explained how he came to give false evidence, despite the government saying two months ago that it was working ""quickly"" to provide an explanation. Witness A has not identified who provided the information which he relied on. There has also been no explanation about who was responsible for authorising the disclosure of X's status to me. Our evidence indicates various MI5 officers were aware of the discussions with me, including case officers and senior counter-terrorism staff. In addition, the government's policy relating to planned departures from NCND says agencies should inform relevant Whitehall colleagues, including the Cabinet Office, in a ""timely fashion"". This means the Cabinet Office and Home Office – as the Whitehall department responsible for MI5 – should have known in advance about the departure from NCND for agent X. In a statement on Wednesday, the government said ministers and civil servants are not ""routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies"" and that they had not been on this occasion. The Security Service is conducting an internal investigation and the government has launched an external review recommending changes to ensure courts are provided with accurate information in future. But there are real concerns about how transparent the two investigations will be. And, if a review now needs to recommend how to ensure MI5 gives accurate evidence to courts, some will wonder what has been happening until now. The question is particularly concerning since courts are required to grant particular discretion to MI5 on questions of national security. Courts and inquiries dealing with such matters frequently sit in secret, yet deal with crucial issues of liberty, life and death - fatal attacks that were not stopped by MI5, people whose British citizenship has been stripped from them, people ordered to live under strict anti-terror powers. MI5 has issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the BBC and all three courts that have been provided with false evidence. ""MI5 takes full responsibility,"" its legal submissions state. It said it understands the importance of ensuring that any evidence it provides is truthful, accurate and complete. And it added: ""It is acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears in this regard, and that the court must be able to trust completely any evidence it provides."" These revelations come at a time of increased scrutiny of the NCND policy, following an inquiry into the British state agent known as ""Stakeknife"", a killer and torturer who informed on the IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Security forces and the government have refused to confirm or deny that Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, who died last year, although the fact is well known. Jon Boutcher, the former head of the inquiry who wrote its interim report, said NCND ""seems to have assumed a totemic status"" within government and the security forces and to have become ""an implacable dogma or mantra with the qualities of a stone wall"". He said the policy ""assumes lawful conduct on the part of the security forces"", which is ""generally a safe assumption"", but which may need ""external testing and verification"". His report recommended the government should review, codify and define the proper limits of the NCND policy in relation to identifying agents in the context of historic cases in Northern Ireland. The government has yet to respond to the recommendation. Beth's case already had a wider implication for MI5 in relation to how it assesses and manages agents, particularly those who pose a risk of violence to women and girls. Now it has taken on wider implication still – about how much MI5's evidence can be taken at face value and relied on, and whether NCND needs to change. The new evidence shows MI5 has not abided by NCND in the case of X and, in fact, wholly abandoned the policy while dismissing the agent's abusive and extremist conduct. It shows MI5 knew what kind of person he was, and captures its dismissive attitude to concerns about his abuse and violence. And it is due to bring to an end to Beth's judicial review case, which had been considering whether MI5 should have been allowed to maintain NCND. MI5 itself has recommended that decision now be considered afresh by the original court, the IPT. Beth will return to court, seeking the truth amid official secrets and lies.

Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities. In fact, MI5 had disclosed the man's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate the man - known publicly only as agent X. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls. The BBC can reveal: In an unprecedented admission, MI5 has now issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the BBC and all three courts, describing what happened as a ""serious error"" and saying ""MI5 takes full responsibility"". There will now be pressure on MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum to explain what he knew, given that the officer said he had been legally authorised to disclose X's role. It also raises concerns about the reliability of MI5's evidence in the courts and the sustainability of one of its core secrecy policies. For agents ""to keep protecting us, we must protect them and their identities from all those who would do them harm,"" said Sir Ken - in a statement released after this article was first published.   ""The use of agents is difficult, human work that is governed by legislation and tightly overseen,"" he added. Beth's case will now head back to the specialist court, which is investigating if the Security Service breached her human rights by failing to protect her from X's abusive and coercive behaviour. It will reconsider whether it was right to rule that the evidence should be heard in closed sessions which she would not be able to attend. Beth's lawyer, Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, told the BBC: ""I think this raises real concerns about MI5's transparency, about whether we can trust MI5's evidence to courts."" MI5's lie can be revealed after the BBC applied to the High Court to report false evidence in a corporate witness statement by a deputy director in the Security Service, known as Witness A. His statement said the service had maintained its long-standing approach to neither confirm nor deny the identity of agents - a policy known by the initials NCND - and gave a false account of the MI5 officer's calls with me. During a short hearing granting permission on Wednesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the relevant MI5 evidence had been ""false"". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has appointed Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government legal service, as an ""independent external reviewer"" to investigate how MI5 came to provide false evidence to the courts. He has also been asked to recommend any changes needed to ensure that courts are provided with accurate information in future by the Security Service. After we reported in 2022 how X terrorised his partner, Ms Cooper - then shadow home secretary - had called for an ""independent assessment"" of the case, looking at the way concerns about ""the appalling and dangerous crime of domestic abuse"" were handled by MI5. MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence which may result in disciplinary action. Following Wednesday's hearing, we can now report that Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC's director general Tim Davie in late 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's original planned story about agent X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, part of government High Court evidence from 2022, recorded him claiming my intended story was ""inaccurate as well as reckless"".  The BBC stood by the reporting and, after the government took us to court, a judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements ""were true"" and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government at court on Wednesday, said the internal MI5 disciplinary process ""indicates the seriousness with which this is being taken"". He said the court will be updated in April. The significance of the disciplinary process for the individuals involved is ""pretty obvious"", Sir James said. The BBC has called into question the lack of explanation from MI5. In legal submissions today, the BBC invited the court to take further steps to ensure that this ""serious breach is properly investigated"" and that the results of any investigation are brought into the public domain. Exposure of MI5's false testimony will also damage its credibility in other court proceedings, where judges are obliged to give enormous weight and deference to the Security Service's evidence. These often involve secret hearings which are closed even to those most affected - including Beth, people whose relatives have been killed in attacks and people whose UK citizenship has been stripped from them. MI5 has acknowledged the issue, saying in legal submissions on Wednesday that it is ""acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears"" and that courts must be able to ""trust completely any evidence it provides"". The Security Service maintains that the NCND policy is essential to maintain national security and keep agents safe. But the BBC revelations will add to concerns about the way the policy is being used, including that it may stand in the way of agents being held accountable when they abuse their positions or commit crimes. Because the senior MI5 officer told me disclosure of the agent's status had been legally authorised, it means it had been signed off by lawyers and other senior figures in MI5. The Home Office and Cabinet Office should also have been informed, according to the policy for departures from NCND. After Wednesday's hearing, a government spokesperson said: ""Ministers and civil servants are not routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies and were not on this occasion."" Meanwhile, in a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was ""clearly a very serious matter to provide incorrect information to the court"" but the government ""maintains and supports the principle of neither confirming nor denying allegations about whether individuals may or may not be operating on behalf of the UK intelligence agencies"". In a new witness statement to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he ""sincerely"" apologised for giving incorrect evidence. He said the false information ""reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2mz3j1e34o,2025-02-12T13:10:35.099Z,Ben Hatton,"Church missed opportunity to hear victims, says bishop","The Church of England's failure to adopt a fully independent safeguarding model was a missed opportunity to make clear it has listened to victims, the bishop tasked with leading on the issue has said.","The Church of England's failure to adopt a fully independent safeguarding model was a missed opportunity to make clear it has listened to victims, the bishop tasked with leading on the issue has said. The Bishop of Stepney, Dr Joanne Grenfell, who is lead bishop for safeguarding, had put forward a motion to the General Synod for all Church-employed safeguarding officers to be transferred to a new independent body.  Dr Grenfell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""very disappointed"", but that the Church had nonetheless adopted changes that amount to a ""big step forward"". Representatives of survivors branded the outcome a ""punch in the gut"" for victims of abuse and said it showed the Church had decided to ""keep it in the family"". It comes as the Church has faced intense scrutiny for its safeguarding practices in recent months after the the former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned over his handling of an abuse case. On Tuesday the Synod, the Church of England's governing body, voted overwhelmingly for a less independent option which will see the creation of an independent central safeguarding team, but with local diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers remaining with their current church employers. Dr Grenfell told the BBC: ""On the one hand I'm really disappointed, as were many, that Synod missed the opportunity to send an unequivocal message to victims and survivors and the wider nation that we hear their pain and concerns.  ""On the other hand, what we did vote to get on with, an independent scrutiny body, is actually quite a big step forward in itself.  ""But we need to do that further work around operational independence, and I'm really committed to doing that."" The Synod had been expected to vote on a model backed by Prof Alexis Jay - who previously chaired the national Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and another model. However, following an amendment, the Prof Jay-backed model - which proposed that all safeguarding staff would be entirely independent of the Church - was not voted on at all, and a less ambitious proposal was adopted. Bishop of Blackburn Philip North, who proposed the amendment to endorse the less independent option while work was done to see if the other one was ""legally deliverable"", described the latter as ""eye-wateringly complex"" and said it could take years to implement. But Dr Grenfell said: ""I don't think we can hide behind those complex structures, that's just not good enough for victims and survivors... ""What I'm concerned about, is that it sounds, it feels to victims and survivors who I have spoken to, that we didn't hear what they were saying and I really want to say to them 'I hear you and we will continue to do this work'."" The Survivors Trust group said public trust in the Church to effectively safeguard children ""has been totally lost"". ""Church leaders must reconsider their approach and take immediate steps toward genuine, independent safeguarding reform,"" it said. Andrew Graystone, an advocate for abuse survivors, accused the Church of ""shocking arrogance"" and said the Synod had ""voted for a measure that will leave the power of bishops completely unchanged and unchallenged"". Dr Grenfell added the Church is going through a ""really painful and necessary time of reckoning"" and there is a ""huge amount to think through before we appoint a new Archbishop of Canterbury"".  The Church has faced criticism for its handling of safeguarding issues, with a damning report into serial abuser and Christian camp leader John Smyth leading to Mr Welby's resignation. The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who has temporarily taken on most of Mr Welby's responsibilities, has also faced criticism over his handling of an abuse case.  Mr Cottrell has said he supports ""independence in safeguarding"" and was ""disappointed"" that it would now happen in ""two stages"". He said he would ""fully commit"" himself to ""implementing Synod's decision and making it happen"". Both the models that had been proposed for changing safeguarding at the Synod took into account the recommendations of independent reports, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, the Church previously said. Also known as the Church's parliament, the Synod meets up to three times a year to debate and pass measures governing how the Church works. It is made up of 478 members who are elected every five years. Correction 14 February 2025: This article originally incorrectly stated the Synod had been expected to vote on a proposal for safeguarding by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson. Sarah Wilkinson previously conducted an independent review into the failure of the Independent Safeguarding Board but this did not involve any specific proposals for future safeguarding models for the Church of England. Prof Jay backed a model of full independence. We have amended our article to make this clear.  The suspension of Rev Canon Alan Bashforth is after a complaint relating to a vulnerable adult. The sudden dropout is ""very unusual"", says editor of the Church Times Sarah Meyrick.  The Diocese of Portsmouth has set out its legal opposition to the Isle of Wight Council plans. The Glebe in Bayston Hill is owned by the church but was fenced off in November.

The hapless superhero first appeared in Nutty comic in 1980 and has featured in the Beano since 2012. In the special edition of the comic, Tindall is depicted wearing a matching blue and yellow suit while teaming up with Bananaman to save Beanotown from a rampaging troll. The 46-year-old ex-England international is married to Zara Tindall, daughter of the Princess Royal. Tindall said: ""Bananaman's 45th birthday is a reminder that fun, laughter, and a bit of mischief never go out of style, and sharing laughter with kids is timeless."" He reflects on his childhood and his rugby career in an editor's letter in the comic. The father-of-three also writes: ""My job now is being a dad and I love it. ""It's important to set a good example, so I play pranks on the kids and their mum."" His letter also encourages children to take on a sport if they have the chance. Bananaman was originally conceived as a playful parody of traditional superheroes, being strong and able to fly but famous for epic failure.

What you will not find anywhere other than Ellesmere Port in Cheshire is a National Milk Bars café. While the chain was never of a scale anything like that of Starbucks, Caffé Nero or Costa Coffee, it was, for a time, a staple of high streets across the north-west of England and Wales. Upon buying the café in the Port Arcades shopping centre, Alisan San had no idea that he was not only trying to keep a business afloat, but was taking on the challenge of keeping a brand alive as well.  National Milk Bars were the brainchild of Welsh dairy farmer Robert ""Willie"" William Griffiths. In the early 1930s, the milk bar phenomenon reached London from the USA. Griffiths saw glasses of milk being sold over smart counters for a few pence a glass, and decided to take the concept back home to Wales. Griffiths and his wife Florence opened the first National Milk Bar in Colwyn Bay in 1933, and ran the chain from the Woodlands farm in Forden, near Welshpool, for a number of years. In their heyday there were 17 National Milk Bars dotted across Wales and the north-west of England, selling dairy-based treats including milkshakes and cream cakes. Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham were all home to a National Milk Bar, and the Liverpool branch – once said to have been paid a visit by the Beatles – is immortalised on the façade of a building on Lime Street that replaced the demolished Futurist cinema. But as tastes changed, so did National Milk Bars' fortunes. And but for the Ellesmere Port outlet, the brand would be consigned to the history books. ""You come in and you feel as though you're amongst friends,"" says regular customer Joy. ""Everybody knows each other by name"". ""We are here every day, every day bar Sunday,"" says Mavis. ""Hopefully we are not going to lose this. Hopefully this will keep going"". Owner Alisan was a chef before he bought the last surviving National Milk Bar. The 45-year-old may have changed the menu and modernised the interior a little, but the signage on the front is the same as it was when the branch opened when the shopping centre was built in the 1980s. Now it faces competition from the major high street brands, with a Caffe Nero having taken up one of the units in the Port Arcades. But he is hopeful that its now-unique charm will see the brand through a few more years. ""For some people, it is more than a coffee shop,"" he says. ""We are like a family here. Everybody knows each other"".

General Synod members instead adopted an alternative proposal described as a ""way forward in the short term"" ahead of a move to full independence in the future. But child safety expert Prof Alexis Jay - who had called for a fully independent model - described the decision as ""deeply disappointing"" and ""devastating for victims and survivors"". The vote comes after a turbulent period for the Church, which has seen the resignation of former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over his handling of an abuse case and criticism of Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell's links to another. Mr Cottrel, who has stepped in as temporary head of the Church, said he supported ""independence in safeguarding"" and was ""disappointed"" that it would now happen ""two stages"". He added that he would ""fully commit"" himself to ""implementing synod's decision and making it happen"". The Church has been accused of failings over the way it dealt with cases of sexual and physical child abuse spanning decades and launched a review of its safeguarding procedures.  The Synod had been expected to vote on a model backed by Prof Alexis Jay - who previously chaired the national Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and another model. However, following an amendment, the Prof Jay-backed model - which proposed that all safeguarding staff would be entirely independent of the Church - was not voted on at all, and a less ambitious proposal was adopted. That will see the creation of an independent central safeguarding team for the Church - but with diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers continuing in the same roles. The alternative model would have also made the Church's safeguarding officers around the country part of that independent body, independent of church organisations. Both the models that had been proposed for changing safeguarding took into account the recommendations of independent reports, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, the Church previously said. Given the turmoil and negative attention the Church has garnered over recent months following major abuse scandals, adopting a more ambitious model would have undoubtedly been an opportunity to send out a clear message that it really was serious about making the Church a safer place. Throughout the debate, many in the chamber – including Mr Cottrell, who has been under pressure and scrutiny himself – implored the synod to take up that opportunity. Earlier, Prof Jay had said the Church risked falling further into crisis if it failed to adopt the more independent system for keeping people safe. Speaking to BBC News after the vote, Prof Jay said: ""It will be devastating for victims and survivors, whose trust and confidence will absolutely not be restored as a consequence of the decision.  ""In fact, it is more likely to alienate them."" Some opponents of the more independent safeguarding model said they were simply worried it could not have been implemented.  Bishop of Blackburn Philip North - who tabled the amendment slimming down the choice put before the synod to one option - argued that the simpler model could be implemented more quickly. He described the other option as ""eye-wateringly complex"" and said it could take years to implement when the Church and nation were ""demanding change now"". He added that while the church implemented the changes - which would allow for a ""far greater degree of independence in safeguarding"" - a fully independent model was still ""very much on the table"" in the longer term. However, at this crucial juncture for the Church, the optics of making a commitment to be as ambitious as possible might have been far better than what they have ended up with. Instead, they the Church appears to have been far less bold - but with a promise they will try to do better in the future. The vote has been strongly condemned by campaigners who have called for sweeping changes to how the Church deals with abuse. Lucy Duckworth from the Survivors Trust told BBC News: ""It is a devastating blow, not just for the victims and survivors of clerical abuse but for the one million children who attend the 4,600 schools under the Church of England's power today. ""This is a shameful disregard for the lifelong suffering that their employees and clergy have caused. ""I feel really let down, speaking both as a survivor of clerical abuse as well as a campaigner and policy adviser who represents survivors."" Andrew Graystone, a victim and survivors' advocate, said the decision to reject a fully independent safeguarding model was a ""punch in the gut for victims and survivors of church abuse"" and accused church leaders of ""shocking arrogance"". Correction 14 February 2025: This article originally suggested that the Synod had been expected to vote on separate proposals for safeguarding by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, with the Wilkinson proposal subsequently adopted. However Sarah Wilkinson's 2023 independent review into the failure of the Independent Safeguarding Board did not involve any proposals for future safeguarding models for the Church of England and we have amended our story to make that clear.

On a visit to HMP Styal, in Wilmslow, Catherine was shown a project designed to develop strong and healthy relationships between mothers and babies ""even in the most challenging of environments"". The princess, in contrast to more glamorous royal engagements, stepped through the security gates in the rain, ahead of a tour of the prison, which holds about 400 inmates, some serving life sentences.  While there, she met specialist staff supporting new mothers, and visited a nursery for babies who will have to spend their first formative months inside a jail. On her fourth official visit to a prison, the princess met women being supported by the Action for Children charity, which runs mother and baby units in three prisons in the north of England. ""Being a mum in prison is difficult,"" a former inmate told her. But she said that the specialist help provided a ""safe space"" and gave her a chance of training and help with learning about parenthood. ""I've made silly decisions and ended up in this position, but you can't turn back the clock. But I've got as much out of it as I could,"" she said, telling the princess that she had embraced what she could learn while in prison. The former inmates also talked about the stigma attached to having a baby in prison - and the princess talked to staff about the importance of ""attachment and bonding"", including for mothers who had faced trauma in their own lives. But there were also shouts and whistles as the royal visitor moved around the prison, with calls from inmates: ""We need more funding. Tell them the truth."" Last year, there were warnings about safety from women who had been inmates at the prison - and there had been an increase in the mental health support budget for the jail. The prison hopes that helping new mothers build a strong connection with their newborns while in jail will reduce the risk of reoffending when inmates are released.  The princess has a strong interest in early years education, as set out in her Shaping Us initiative, which emphasises the importance of the first five years of a child's life. Tuesday's visit to HMP Styal continues this campaign to raise awareness of those early years. It is the latest in a series of engagements this year, as the princess returns to work after the end of her cancer treatment The unit at HMP Styal provides a separate area for new and expectant mothers. Stuffed toys were dotted around the unit, that tries to create a different atmosphere to regular prison life. There is nursing care and support for both the mothers and their babies - who may spend their first 18 months in prison. Figures from the Ministry of Justice estimate that there are about 200,000 children in England and Wales with a parent, either a mother or father, in prison. There has often been attention on what the princess is wearing on such visits, with interest in her fashion choices - and it has been clarified by Kensington Palace aides on Tuesday that there is no change in the policy of sharing details of her clothing. The palace will sometimes issue details of what the princess is wearing, but not necessarily always, with ""no change in our approach"", says a palace spokesperson.

The heavy metal pioneers will headline the one-day festival featuring dozens of bands they inspired, including Metallica, Pantera, Slayer, Gojira and Anthrax. Osbourne, who has largely been forced to stop touring due to a combination of Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries, will play a short solo set before joining his bandmates. Asked about people being in Birmingham when the concert takes place, West Midlands Growth Company's head of tourism, Becky Frall, said ""we've already seen a spike in forward bookings for the Ozzy [date]"". She added everyone had got ""really quick off the draw"" and she thought they were ""sort of anticipating their ticket"". ""Already when we have press tours in, when we show tour operators around, everyone wants to go and see Ozzy [the] bull in New Street station,"" Ms Frall said. ""Everyone wants to go and get their photo taken on the Black Sabbath Bridge on the bench there. ""The Home of Metal festival has for many years brought in international visitors who are really engaged with that metal scene so we've got a brilliant heritage there.""

About 750 mourners paid their respects to one of the game's all-time greats at his funeral earlier. More than 1,000 fans gathered at Old Trafford to applaud as the cortege passed the stadium, pausing at the Trinity statue which depicts him alongside Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best, and then travelling on to Manchester Cathedral. The Red Devils icon and only Scotsman to ever be named the world's best player died last month aged 84. Footballers past and present turned up to pay their respects to Law as well as Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson who described Law as ""my hero"" and current manager Ruben Amorim. Among the myriad of United legends who paid their respects, some of Manchester City's greats joined the mourners where Law also played. These included Law's former teammates Joe Corrigan and Mike Summerbee. The funeral procession arrived at Manchester Cathedral to the sound of bagpipes playing Flower of Scotland. Diana Law paid tribute to her late father, who she said has now reunited with club greats Charlton and Best. She said: ""There is an Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman. I think of them all up there in heaven. Reunited smiling down. Maybe they have started a team already with Sir Matt as the manager."" Sir Alex also paid tribute to his fellow Scotsman at the service. ""Trying to place Denis in the pantheon of all time greats is a challenge. But it is made easier by Pele. ""He was asked if there was a British player who could get in the [great] Brazil team. He said Denis Law - which is a fantastic tribute."" Sir Alex then talked about Law's love for Scotland and how ""he loved beating England"". ""He once lined up before a game against England.  ""He loved Nobby Stiles and Nobby worshipped him. Nobby came bounding down the tunnel and wished Denis all the best. ""Denis gave him a withering look and let off a volley of abuse Nobby never forgot."" Sir Alex went on to say he often wondered why supporters called him The King, and came to the conclusion ""it was to do with his profile"". ""He would fight his granny for a goal,"" he said. ""He had so much courage. A skinny guy standing among all those big defenders."" Leading the service, Cannon Grace Thomas told mourners Law's death marked ""the end of an era, the last of the famous Trinity to go"". ""But what a wonderful legacy he leaves behind for supporters. And also in the hearts, minds and memories of all who loved him,"" she said. Rod Stewart's rendition of Angel was played as the service ended. Law who was born in Aberdeen in 1940 was capped 55 times for Scotland. He remains the country's joint-top scorer of all time with 30 goals. Law started out at Huddersfield Town at the age of 15 before going to United's great rivals, Manchester City. He left City for Italy's Torino after a year but moved back to Manchester to join United in 1962. It was the third transfer involving Law to set a new British record fee. Law spent 11 years at Old Trafford, where his 237 goals in 404 appearances have kept him in third place on United's all-time goal scorers list, behind Wayne Rooney and his former teammate Charlton. His time at the club saw it win two league titles, the FA Cup the European Cup as the first English team to do so.

The Church's national assembly will vote later on Tuesday on options to radically change its safeguarding processes. One of the systems being considered is based on a model proposed by Prof Alexis Jay, who was asked by the Church for her input. But some members of the Church have cast doubts about the system that comprehensively hands the process for dealing with abuse allegations to an outside organisation. The resignation of the former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over his handling of a prolific abuser and questions about Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell's handling of another case have added a sense of urgency to make changes. At the Church's General Synod, two models are being put to the vote on Tuesday, both involving some measure of independence. The first involves creating an independent central safeguarding team for the Church - but with diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers continuing in the same roles. The second would also make the Church's safeguarding officers around the country part of that independent body. Both options would see safeguarding work scrutinised by a second external body, but a 66-page document published last month said it would take ""a minimum of two years to legislate for a scrutiny body as a statutory body"". After years of the Church of England being accused of failing to ""mark its own homework"", Prof Jay, a respected figure in child protection, feels only the second model goes far enough. ""I think it's absolutely necessary because church safeguarding as it stands falls below the standards of secular organisations, and I do not think that can continue when it has also led to such serious weaknesses,"" she told the BBC. In October 2022, Prof Jay finished a seven-year inquiry into the countless ways children had been sexually abused in England and Wales with her team investigating abuse in churches, schools, custodial institutions, political parties, religious groups, and children's homes. In summer 2023, Prof Jay was asked by Archbishop Justin Welby to advise on how the Church could ""outsource"" safeguarding. She said she was not asked to investigate whether the Church needed safeguarding that was independent of the Church. ""I'm glad the General Synod is going to be debating a model that largely reflects what I was asked to do in the report I published last year, a model of full independence,"" she said. Prof Jay said there would be dire consequences if Synod members did not vote for the more complete model of independence. ""I think that not adopting that version would mean it would be a matter of time before yet more safeguarding crises occurred, and there would be a renewed calls for radical action to be taken,"" she said. Some within the Church have raised concerns about Prof Jay's preferred option because they fear it is too radical a model and not a well-tested one. ""Whether or not there are precedents is absolutely not the point,"" she said. ""There is also the option for the Church to commission an existing charity with a track record in care and support for children and vulnerable adults to ask them to carry out this work."" Prof Jay also dismissed suggestions that making the system independent would mean that some within the Church would no longer feel safeguarding was their responsibility too. But she said choosing the correct system to deal with abuse allegations would only resolve part of the problem, saying cultural issues - like deference to authority figures in the Church - were also hampering progress. Some within the Church have questioned Prof Jay's understanding of the way in which the institution works but she said it was criticism she expected. ""I was asked to do a piece of work. I did it. I knew quite well that it would be problematic for some, but the Church must face up to its responsibilities and do what they need to do,"" she said. If it is voted through, the fully independent model should then be delivered by a team committed to its success, she added. It is estimated that could yet take around three years. Dame Jasvinder Sanghera was a survivor advocate on the Church of England's independent safeguarding board until the panel was sacked in June 2023 when the church said relations between board members and bishops had ""broken down"". ""The church can no longer be trusted to manage safeguarding. The current system fails to prevent abuse and cover up,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. She said the Church needed ""independent oversight that stands up to scrutiny, not a design designed by the Church of England where they have their hand over it - it has to be a regulatory body that is independent from the church"". Asked on the programme if she believed that there are many other bishops and archbishops that if they had to submit to this sort of scrutiny would find themselves having to stand aside from their positions, she said: ""Yes I do, actually, I do."" ""From what I'm hearing in relation to how bishops are given different treatment, to what I'm hearing from survivors in relation to complaints that they have put forward, there are individuals who remain within that organisation that really should be stepping aside,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Church of England said the Church is ""committed to making safeguarding as robust and independent as possible"" and the Synod will decide between two proposed models that significantly strengthen the independence of safeguarding structures while ensuring effective oversight and scrutiny"". ""Both models involve the creation of a new external body to scrutinise safeguarding work, and both take into account the recommendations of independent reviews, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and Sarah Wilkinson. ""The proposals have been developed through extensive consultation, including with victims and survivors, and represent a significant step forward in strengthening safeguarding across the Church. ""We recognise the deep and lasting impact of abuse and are committed to ensuring that safeguarding in the Church is independent, transparent, and accountable. ""It is right that Synod now considers these proposals and determines the best way forward."" The replica is being exhbitied at St Wulfram's in Grantham until 3 March. The report into prolific abuser John Smyth accuses several members of the Church of safeguarding failures. The suspension of Rev Canon Alan Bashforth is after a complaint relating to a vulnerable adult. The sudden dropout is ""very unusual"", says editor of the Church Times Sarah Meyrick.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rq2g0kz1lo,2025-02-11T11:51:47.930Z,Rahil Sheikh,'Billionaires own my mouldy rental property',"""I fear for his health because I know once it comes back, his health starts to deteriorate all over again,"" says Sinead as she shows us the mould staining the walls of the flat she shares with her son.","""I fear for his health because I know once it comes back, his health starts to deteriorate all over again,"" says Sinead as she shows us the mould staining the walls of the flat she shares with her son. When she and five-year-old Aziyah moved into their home in Brighton in 2020, it seemed in good condition. But black mould quickly began to appear. Over the next two years it spread all over the walls, even onto the beds and furniture. The 25-year-old, who privately rents for £1,100 a month, initially reported it to her landlord, but despite their attempt to improve ventilation, the problem remained. A year later, Aziyah began to develop health issues and was later diagnosed with asthma. Five years since it all started, despite repeated complaints to her landlord and her local council, Sinead's mould problem has not been solved and she feels trapped. ""No matter how loud I scream, I'm not being heard,"" she says. More than half a million rented homes - both private and social - have black mould issues in England, a 2023 government survey found. In Rotherham, we met an elderly couple who have lived in the same privately rented house for more than 50 years. It has peeling wallpaper, wet walls, large black mould patches and an overwhelming smell of damp. When asked what effect it is having, 82-year-old Christine Brown told us: ""Do you want the truth? I just wish I were dead. That's how it's got me."" Christine, and husband Paul, 74, have a protected tenancy which keeps the rent low, at £440 per month. They did not know who their landlord was. All communication was through a letting agent. After some digging, Panorama discovered the house is owned by a large property company, run by a billionaire family. Christine suffers from asthma, angina and bronchitis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a progressive lung condition she believes was caused by the mould. Mould exposure can badly affect people with COPD or asthma as it can trigger an irritant response. ""Your airways close up, you start coughing,"" says the chair of the Royal College of GPs, Kamila Hawthorne. ""There's more chance of you picking up an infection and you're more likely then to need antibiotics and/or steroids - and possibly even a hospital admission."" More than 26,000 babies and toddlers were admitted to hospital last year with lung conditions probably linked to exposure to damp and mould, Panorama analysis of NHS England data has found. After two-year-old Awaab Ishak's death in 2020 was found to have been directly linked to mould exposure, the then-Conservative government drew up a new law in his name to protect social tenants in England from unsafe living conditions. But the legislation is yet to come into effect. The government announced the law will be enforced for damp and mould problems from October - and fully implemented for all other hazards by 2027. Private renters will be protected in the same way - says the government - once its Renters' Rights Bill becomes law, expected later this year. In Awaab's case, his father Faisal had repeatedly raised the mould problem with the housing association responsible for the family's Rochdale flat, but no action was taken. Faisal is frustrated the change has taken so long. ""They should bring it through as soon as possible,"" he says. ""It's going to be saving a lot of people's lives."" In Brighton, as Aziyah's health worsened, Sinead says she was ""really scared"" and ""feared for his life"". ""He was coughing and vomiting,"" she says, which medical records show had led to dangerously low blood sugar. At another point, he had a persistent cough for eight months. ""He said, 'Mummy, how do you stop this coughing?' And I said, 'You can't, Aziyah,'"" says Sinead. After she complained to the council - which is responsible for ensuring landlords maintain housing standards - the landlord installed extractor fans and provided dehumidifiers. But the mould remained. In many cases, local authorities are not enforcing private landlords' legal duty to maintain safe housing. We asked every local authority in England and Wales for the number of complaints they had received about housing issues and what enforcement action they had taken. In the past seven years, there were more than 570,000 complaints (from 255 council responses, after 317 requests) about privately rented homes. In more than 90% of cases, no action was taken and fewer than 1% of complaints resulted in a landlord being prosecuted. Councils are facing significant ongoing and historic challenges with resourcing, says the Local Government Association that speaks for authorities in England and Wales. ""Issues may be resolved without the need for inspection, with enforcement and prosecution being a last resort when all other options fail,"" it adds. Over the past 10 years, council funding in England has gone down by 10% in real terms, according to the National Audit Office. ""There is a perfect storm now happening, some of which is around really stretched funding, some of which is around the age of homes,"" England's Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway says. In England alone, more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard, according to a government survey. The homes are either in a state of disrepair, do not have modern kitchen and bathroom facilities, or lack adequate heating and insulation. When Christine shows us around her privately-rented home in Maltby, Rotherham, there are visible issues with damp in every room. ""I'm sick of seeing it like this. My house has never been like this. When I was younger and working I could do it [repair the house] myself,"" she says. ""We just can't do it now."" The couple say they first told their managing agent, Savills, about the problems in 2022. Savills says it authorised work for the house, including having the roof resurfaced in 2023 - but water is still getting in, including from the adjoining property, and many other problems remain. BBC Panorama wanted to find out who was ultimately responsible for the condition of the home. It is owned by a company called Area Estates Ltd, which Companies House records show is part of the William Pears Group. Two of the three brothers who are directors of the group live in some of the most expensive postcodes in London. One of them, Mark Pears, is also on the 2024 Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated family wealth of more than £3bn. He is also a trustee of the British Museum. His brother and fellow director Sir Trevor Pears was knighted in 2017 for his charity work. Area Estates told us it had authorised professional managing agents ""to look after the [Rotherham] property in accordance with all regulations"", and to ""carry out day-to-day maintenance"", and that requests for more expensive repairs were always responded to quickly. ""The managing agents will reinspect the house shortly and attend to any repair issues found which are the landlord's responsibility,"" it added. Managing agent Savills said it was ""very sorry to learn that Mrs Brown believes that complaints have been in any way ignored"". It said it had always attempted to address any problems in a timely manner - and had completed 13 different inspection and repair works at the property between 2023 and 2024. When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: ""I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'."" Since Area Estates was contacted, Savills has arranged for new windows to be fitted and the house to be redecorated. The agent says all remedial works have now been completed with the ""exception of an outstanding matter regarding a 'lean to' building, erected by the tenant, to which further works may be required to make it water tight"". In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was ""unfit for human habitation"". Sinead also applied for social housing, submitting evidence about Aziyah's health. But the council said he had not had ""frequent A&E visits with hospital admissions and complex treatment"". Brighton and Hove City Council says the issues it has the legal power to enforce at Sinead's flat have now been addressed by the private landlord. It says it has also recommended improvements to ""ventilation and insulation"" that it ""can encourage but cannot enforce"". Sinead's landlord accepts that ""there is a problem with condensation"" but says the continuing issues are ""due to neglect"" by her not clearing away condensation. Keeping a consistent temperature and ventilation can help prevent mould growth - but it will not solve the problem if faults with the building mean there is poor ventilation or damp is coming in. Meanwhile, despite the flat having been cleaned and repainted last summer, the mould is coming back. Aziyah's cough still hasn't cleared up and he has been referred to a lung specialist. ""It's my son that keeps me going,"" says Sinead. ""If I don't fight this, then who will fight for him?"" Update: This article has been updated to make clear that more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard. It originally said three million social tenants. Update Tuesday 11 February: This article now includes additional comment from managing agent Savills regarding the latest remedial work on Christine and Paul's home. Southern Housing has informed residents about its plans to refurbish Four Courts in St Leonards.  Tenants will instead be offered five-year leases designed to free up stock as family needs change. Bristol City Council said an independent investigation will take place. The authority welcomed the Exceptional Financial Support cash saying it help replenish general reserves. Slough Borough Council says a mum of four will have a ""considerable wait"" for a new home. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Mr Cottrell, who has stepped in as head of the Church, was speaking after the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen Ann-Hartley, said he was the ""wrong person"" to bring much-needed reform. Bishop Hartley has called for Mr Cottrell's resignation, after he faced criticism for his handling of a sexual abuse case last year. The Church is searching to replace Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who stood down last year amid criticism of his and the Church's handling of the prolific child abuser John Smyth. Mr Cottrell came under fire in December after a BBC investigation revealed he had allowed a priest to remain in post despite knowing he was barred from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse victim. In an opening address, Mr Cottrell said the Church of England is facing ""difficult and challenging times"" and acknowledged the ""anguish, anger, sadness and regret"" that victims and survivors of abuse feel about recent safeguarding failings. Before he spoke, a vote which would have stopped Mr Cottrell from giving the opening address at the synod failed. The vote, proposed by a lay member of the General Synod, argued Mr Cottrell's position was ""no longer tenable"".  Some 73 synod members voted in favour, 239 against and 43 abstained, allowing the address to go ahead. Sam Margrave, from the Diocese of Coventry, tabled the motion. He told the BBC that people ""up and down the country... [have] lost confidence in their archbishops, and it's time for action, not time for silence"". Mr Margrave said he originally put forward a motion calling for Mr Cottrell to resign but was told he ""wasn't allowed to"". He continued: ""I think that decision was wrong and I think General Synod should have a vote whether we have confidence, but this was one way to express our dissatisfaction. ""There were large numbers of people who have spoken and said 'we don't have confidence in the archbishop, and it really is time for him to go'."" That dramatic start to General Synod only added to the sense that this was something of a crisis meeting. Over recent months the Church of England has been left shell-shocked by Justin Welby's resignation and the subsequent scandals that have been swirling around leaders of the institution. The subdued nature of the gathering on Monday reflected the cloud under which it takes place.   However, others expressed resentment over the calls for Mr Cottrell to resign and what some have described as ""trial by media"". Speaking to the BBC, Bishop of Dover Rose Hudson-Wilkin said: ""This sort of febrile attitude... this is not about a boardroom meeting… this is the church, we are about the business of God."" She said the gathering should be viewed as ""an opportunity for the church to stop and take stock, as it were"". During his address at the synod, Mr Cottrell said: ""I know mistakes have been made and I know that I have made mistakes."" He added that he is ""determined to do what I can"" to ""lead the change we all know we need"". The synod is expected to hold significant discussions about safeguarding measures this week, after the Church faced criticism for its handling of child abuse spanning decades in a scathing report last year. Bishop Hartley was the first senior member of the clergy to call for Mr Welby's resignation after the report into the Smyth case was published. She said she is now viewed as a troublemaker by some of her colleagues in the clergy, with one branding her as the ""Bishop of Negativity"". ""I think that's really sad,"" she said, adding that she believed others may have joined her in speaking out if ""fear"" had not stopped them. Also known as the Church's parliament, the General Synod meets up to three times a year to debate and pass measures governing how the Church works. It is made up of 478 members who are elected every five years. Victims and survivors of abuse, along with several members of the clergy, have called for safeguarding reform, and the subject has been placed on this week's synod agenda. Bishop Hartley said Mr Cottrell was not the right man to oversee the reform process. ""I do not think that it's appropriate for the Archbishop of York to be in post, and certainly to be leading change that the Church needs at this time,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Criticism of Mr Cottrell grew after the BBC revealed last year that he had allowed priest David Tudor to remain in post despite a ban on contact with children and past compensation pay outs. ""To allow Tudor to remain in post, I do find abhorrent,"" Bishop Hartley said. She also criticised Mr Cottrell reportedly praising Tudor as a ""Rolls Royce priest"" despite knowing about the settlement.  Since the BBC investigation was first published, Mr Cottrell has said he is ""deeply sorry"" that action could not be taken earlier, but that was the situation he inherited. Tudor was banned from ministry last year. A 2024 report by child safety expert Professor Alexis Jay found that the Church of England's safeguarding measures fell below the standards expected of secular organisations. A spokesperson for the Church of England said the synod will decide between ""two proposed models that significantly strengthen the independence of safeguarding structures"" this week.  ""We recognise the deep and lasting impact of abuse and are committed to ensuring that safeguarding in the Church is independent, transparent, and accountable,"" they added. The suspension of Rev Canon Alan Bashforth is after a complaint relating to a vulnerable adult. The sudden dropout is ""very unusual"", says editor of the Church Times Sarah Meyrick.  The Diocese of Portsmouth has set out its legal opposition to the Isle of Wight Council plans. The Glebe in Bayston Hill is owned by the church but was fenced off in November.

Domas Paskauskas, 38, of Peterborough, and Donatas Sukys, 41, from Spalding, were stopped by border officers at Cairnryan bound for Northern Ireland in October 2022. The lorry they were travelling in was pulled over and officials noticed a strong smell of aftershave in the cab and a search was carried out. The pair admitted being concerned in the supply of both cannabis and cocaine at the High Court in Edinburgh and their sentence was deferred. The court heard that nothing untoward was found in their trailer, but 16 packages were recovered from the cab with the smell of herbal cannabis coming from many of them. Officers suspected some of the packages might contain Class A drugs and more than three kilogrammes of high purity cocaine was found after a Paul Smith designer bag in the cab was checked. Judge Paul Brown was told that the cocaine was 78% pure and had the potential to be worth in excess of £300,000 in street deals. More than 25kg of the Class B drug cannabis was also recovered which had a potential maximum street value of more than £250,000. Paskauskas, of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, and Donatas Sukys, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, admitted being concerned in the supply of both cannabis and cocaine at the port on 2 October 2022. Both men had Lithuanian interpreters present in court with them to help them  follow the legal proceedings. The court heard that Paskauskas, a lorry driver and sole director of a company, was approached by ""a third party"" who asked him to transport a consignment of goods to Northern Ireland. He claimed he was told that cannabis was involved, but not cocaine. Paskauskas was disqualified from driving at the time and approached Sukys to drive the load and told him the consignment contained cannabis. Defence counsel Frances Connor, for Paskauskas, said neither of the accused had served a prison sentence previously. The judge adjourned sentence for the preparation of background reports on the pair and they were remanded in custody.

At least six cases have already been settled out of court by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), with dozens of other air crew and families understood to be in the process of suing. They claim that officials knew about safety concerns with certain aircraft as far back as 1999, but chose not to tell the crew or introduce sufficient safety precautions. The MoD says it takes ""the health of our personnel extremely seriously"" and is currently testing the exhaust emissions of some military helicopters. Diseases contracted by some of the crew who flew the helicopters include lung cancer, throat cancer, testicular cancer and some rare forms of blood cancer. The Times reported last year that at least three former air crew have died and others have been told their cancer is terminal. It's understood the government accepts that the design of some rotary wing aircraft increases the likelihood of engine exhaust fumes entering the cabin. Benzene, which is a known human carcinogen, is an element present in aircraft fuel. In November, the government began testing helicopter exhaust fumes, but it's understood that officials still believe there is no risk to health. The MoD has confirmed it is now carrying out work to determine the number of armed forces personnel who have served as air crew and been diagnosed with cancer. It's understood that this work officially began earlier this year; covers the RAF, the Army and the Navy, and will include veterans as well as active personnel. When approached by BBC News, the MoD was unable to say when it hopes to come up with an initial estimate of the number of people potentially affected. But one Westminster source familiar with the work said that complexities around accessing veterans' health records mean it is likely to take years. More than 150 people are thought to have approached law firms claiming to have been affected, but many will not be eligible for compensation, as the law allowing claims against the MoD only came into effect in 1987. At least four types of aircraft have been named in legal documents, including the Sea King, Westland Wessex, Puma and CH-47 Chinook. The law firm Hugh James, which is representing many of the families affected, claims that risks surrounding the Sea King were made clear to the MoD in 1999. They said a report ""recommended modifications to the aircraft to divert the exhaust fumes"" but claimed the MoD ""failed to act on these recommendations"" and ""failed to make servicemen aware of the potential dangers and the risk of cancers developing"". The Sea King was used in British military operations between 1969 and 2018 and has in the past been flown by both King Charles and the Prince of Wales. The Westland Wessex was retired in 2003, while the Puma and CH-47 Chinook are still in use. The MoD pointed to previous helicopter tests carried out on behalf of the RAF that didn't show any indication air crew were being exposed to dangerous levels of contaminants. Louisa Donaghy, a senior associate at Hugh James, said the firm was representing more than 40 former military personnel but warned there could be more.  ""It's encouraging that the MoD has begun work to understand the scale of this issue, but the process must be swift and transparent,"" she said. ""Every delay means more veterans and service personnel could be left without the support they need. Given the challenges in accessing veterans' records, it's vital that the government commits the necessary resources to ensure no one is overlooked."" Last month BBC News used a Freedom of Information request to ask the MoD how many current and former air crew they are aware of who've been diagnosed with cancer. They said they didn't hold the data centrally, but confirmed in their response that the work to establish the number of people affected was under way. A spokesperson for the MoD said they ""take the health of our personnel extremely seriously and regularly review our processes to ensure that we're doing what we can to keep our people safe"". They added that it was ""essential that we can assure our people of their safety at work"". Copyright 2025 BBC.

Both committed to making all Holocaust records public in 2022 and said many of the records have since been digitised and made available online, with work ongoing to complete the digitisation. Jersey Heritage said many records were available, including files from German troop courts as well as naturalisation and immigration files covering ""people of Jewish faith"". A spokesperson for Guernsey's Island Archives said a ""significant amount of work"" had been done to preserve records from the bailiwick's occupation. The UK Government also committed to making all Holocaust records public in 2022. Jersey Heritage said it had identified one record relating to Jewish people in the naturalisation files - about a former Austrian citizen and his wife, staying in London, who had applied to come to Jersey. Letters from the file showed the couple's application was refused and they applied to the Home Office for a travel document to move to America. Jersey Heritage said its immigration files also showed details of five Jewish people who applied to come to the islands in the 1930s, adding the records showed ""the States of Jersey policy towards Jewish immigration at the time"".  It said there were ""still some records closed from the occupation period but these were documents subject to standard closure periods and were not unique to the occupation"", such as education and hospital records. A spokesperson for the States of Guernsey said staff at the Island Archives were about halfway through the current batch of digitisation, but expected it to be several years before all records had been digitised. Island Archives said ""some of the most popular records"" had been digitised and were available online, while others were available to view in person. It said overseas people doing research could also contact the Island Archives to put them in touch with a local researcher. Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook. Follow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

Friday's dinner, with guests including David and Victoria Beckham, Dame Helen Mirren and Donatella Versace, was a culinary warm-up for the royal couple's state visit to Italy and the Vatican in early April, where they will meet Pope Francis. The trip is expected to coincide with Charles and Camilla's 20th wedding anniversary and the King told dinner guests about his love of Italian food and culture. ""Good food brings people together and what we choose to eat helps to define us - as families, communities and nations,"" said the King. The UK-Italy dinner, hosted by the King and Queen at their Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, and with the Italian ambassador to the UK, Inigo Lambertini, was a celebration of ""slow food"", which uses fresh local food and traditional cooking methods. Other guests included former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful and chefs Raymond Blanc and Angela Hartnett. The King hailed this ""most splendid evening which brings together two things very dear to my heart - slow food and Italy"". ""A nation's food culture is a priceless social and environmental asset, intimately bound up with its sense of identity and place,"" said the King. An enthusiast for art, culture and religion, he spoke of his enthusiasm for the state visit, which will be his 18th official visit to the country. ""To say that we are looking forward to it would be to engage in a little British understatement,"" he joked to diners, including Stanley Tucci, who inspired the choice of food. The reception and dinner menu, cooked by Calabrian chef Francesco Mazzei, featured Italian recipes with British ingredients. It was accompanied by English sparkling wine and Italian red and white wines. Reception: Rare and pasture salumi Tuscan-style paté and coppa Yorkshire pecorino cheese puffs British vegetables caponata tartelletta with Highgrove sparkling wine  Dinner: Scottish crab panzanella Westcombe ricotta and Highgrove fine herbs ravioli Isle of Wight tomato passata Suffolk Red porchetta Pumpkin and sage mash, Tuscan kale with white wine Gavi dei Gavi La Scolca Black label 2023 and red wine Barbaresco Gaja 2021 Zuppa Inglese and biscotti with a red dessert wine, Recioto della Valpolicella Classico Zenato Some of the British guests in attendance had strong links to Italy. Dame Helen and her husband have a house in Puglia, in the south of the country, where they spend six months out of the year. She previously told a local TV show that she is learning to speak Italian, and has found ""nothing but kindness"" in the area where she lives. And it is sometimes forgotten that David Beckham played 29 matches for AC Milan in two loans spells in 2009 and 2010 as he sought to prove his match fitness to play for England in the 2010 World Cup. But it was a bittersweet experience as the second spell was cut short by an Achilles tendon injury that ultimately ruled him out of the World Cup in South Africa. King Charles said of the combined culinary efforts of chef Mazzei and Tucci: ""I can only hope they are still talking to each other at the end of it all!"" Cocktails were made by ""mixologist"" Alessandro Palazzi, using herbs from the gardens at Highgrove. There was a toast made by the King in Italian, ""alla eterna cultura italiana del buon cibo,"" meaning ""to Italy's timeless food culture"". This dinner comes ahead of the state visit in early April, confirmed on Thursday by Buckingham Palace. There will be engagements in Rome and Ravenna, with the King and Queen set to hold meetings with Pope Francis and Italian political leaders.

Dominic Hampshire played a key role in the development of Yang Tengbo's relationship with the Duke of York - but the full details of what happened between the three men remain unclear. Last month a court rejected Mr Yang's appeal against being banned from the UK, after an intelligence assessment that he could be secretly working for the Chinese state. Mr Yang has denied all wrongdoing. Lawyers for the BBC and other media organisations argued at the Special Immigrations Appeal Commission (Siac) on Friday that Mr Hampshire could not keep his account private simply because he had lacked the ""common sense"" to find out if it might become public. In December, the court said Mr Yang had formed an ""unusual degree of trust"" with the prince and had not disclosed his links to an arm of the Chinese Communist Party clandestinely involved in political interference. It upheld the home secretary's conclusion that he was a threat to national security. The BBC and other news organisations are now asking Siac to release a witness statement that Mr Hampshire wrote in support of Mr Yang after the aide had been first contacted by British intelligence. In submissions on Friday, lawyers for Mr Hampshire said that he had sought assurances from Mr Yang's lawyers that the witness statement would remain private - and he had only realised it could become public when he arrived at the appeal hearing last July. Mr Hampshire then withdrew the statement in an attempt to prevent it from becoming public. ""I was told that the information [in the statement] would be kept private and confidential,"" Mr Hampshire said to the court in written submissions on Friday. ""If there was any question of this being available in the public domain, I was not warned of it. ""If I had been, I would never have agreed to submit a witness statement, much less go into the level of confidential detail which I did. ""I wrote what I did in the statement with such candour – including about my own confidential commercial interests but also about the private interests of third parties – in the expectation it was for the private attention of one of the most senior ministries of state on a grave matter. ""I quite simply would not have volunteered to write about those matters had I known that there was any chance, however small, that it was for use in a forum which was or could become public."" Adam Wolanski KC, representing the media organisations, said there was an exceptionally strong public interest case to release Mr Hampshire's account to journalists, along with other documents that remain confidential. ""It is extraordinary that a person in Mr Hampshire's position, apparently charged with dealing with confidential and sensitive matters on behalf of the Duke of York, did not bother obtaining his own legal advice before agreeing to provide a witness statement to Mr Yang,"" said Mr Wolanski in written submissions. ""Mr Hampshire cannot now pray in aid his mystifying and unexplained decision to give a witness statement in this obviously highly contentious matter without seeking his own legal advice. ""He should not be permitted to benefit from his, to put it kindly, lack of common sense and his bad decision to proceed without legal advice. ""The court must instead proceed on the basis that he made this decision with his eyes open, knowing the risk that the evidence may become public."" Mr Yang became a highly trusted confidante of Prince Andrew following the duke's interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme in November 2019, which detailed the Duke's friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The fallout from the interview led to the prince withdrawing from public duties - and the end of his commercially successful Dragons Den-style investor events in the UK and China. In March 2020, Mr Hampshire told Mr Yang in a letter that he had managed to salvage the prince's reputation in China. Seven months later the businessman was authorised to represent the prince in China in a planned $3bn investment fund. The ""Eurasia Fund"" scheme aimed to raise cash to invest in Chinese state projects in Africa and the Middle East. Developing the regions is a cornerstone of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to expand its diplomatic and financial reach. The discovery of the scheme, and the fear that the prince was being drawn into a complex Beijing plan to influence him, led the home secretary to ban Mr Yang from the UK. He has denied all wrongdoing - saying he is a legitimate businessman who has worked for decades to improve links between China and the UK. Mr Yang came to study in the UK in 2002 and later set up a series of China-related travel and business consultancy firms. He met the Duke of York in 2014 and later took on a role in the China-based version of Prince Andrew's ""Pitch@Palace"" events, in which entrepreneurs sell their ideas to investors. Siac will rule later on whether further documents from the case will be made public. The Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, spoke to flood victims on Wednesday. The royal couple were in Pontypridd to see how the community was coping following recent floods. The Prince and Princess of Wales also went to Pontypridd to learn how the community is dealing with floods. Tickets will be available for tours of St James's Palace in April and May at a cost of £85. Jason Knauf says the Prince of Wales was deeply affected by the Princess of Wales's cancer diagnosis. Copyright 2025 BBC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08dz47v8ro,2025-02-07T17:35:49.893Z,Jo Adnitt and Kirstie Brewer,'His hands were everywhere' - women accuse surviving Fayed brother of sexual assault,Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store.,"Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store. Speaking publicly for the first time, the women say Ali Fayed, 82, assaulted them in the 1990s when he and his brothers, Mohamed and Salah, owned and ran Harrods. A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said the businessman ""will not be scapegoated"" and he ""unequivocally denies any and all the allegations of wrongdoing"" and that ""the incidents simply never took place"". Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence The alleged sexual assaults happened in London, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States. One of the women, a former interior designer for Harrods, says one assault happened on a work trip while she was staying with Ali Fayed and his family at their former home in Connecticut. ""His hands were everywhere,"" she says, and he stopped because ""one of his little boys started calling for him"". All three women say prior to Ali Fayed's alleged assaults, they had also been sexually abused by his older brother. Police say 111 women have now made allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, who added the Arabic ""Al"" prefix to his surname sometime in the 1970s. One of the women, Amy, has told the BBC she wants ""an explanation"" from Ali Fayed, and an ""understanding of what was going on that can help [her] step forward and begin healing"". All three say they didn't feel able to speak out at the time. ""This is my chance to finally stand up for myself. I'm not going to be that scared 24-year-old who doesn't know what to do,"" says Frances - who, like Amy, has waived her right to anonymity. Frances took a job working for Harrods in the store's interior design studio in 1989. It wasn't long before Mohamed Al Fayed began to bully and sexually abuse her, she says. Frances says she recalls him regularly trying to grab her breasts and grope her while at work, or subjecting her to ""foul"" verbal tirades. Despite not having much experience, Frances says she was tasked with renovating Mohamed Al Fayed's sprawling Scottish Balnagown Estate, including a farmhouse belonging to his younger brother, Ali. Frances describes Ali Fayed's demeanour as calmer than that of Mohamed. ""I think for a moment I thought maybe he would be kinder to me,"" she says. ""But he wasn't."" Ali Fayed, like Mohamed, also had a private office and private apartment in 60 Park Lane in central London. It was in Ali's office where Frances says his sexual abuse started with him ""trying to kiss"" her, followed by him ""groping"" and ""molesting"" her. She says both the Fayed brothers would regularly give her gifts. ""With Mohamed, it would often be wads of cash, Ali would give jewellery or clothes. It would be a see-saw between abusive behaviour then praise for my work and these lavish items."" The abuse escalated in 1992, she says, when she flew to Connecticut to discuss interior design plans with Ali Fayed's wife. ""It was this huge private house and it was decorated in an English country house style. I don't think I'd ever seen anything like it in my life,"" says Frances. ""I remember his wife taking me into this picture-perfect American rich town."" Frances says she was staying in a guest room at the family's house when Ali Fayed told her to get changed for dinner one evening. ""I was in the bathroom and got undressed. When I came out in my underwear, he [Ali] was just standing there in the room. I hadn't heard him come in or knock."" Frances says Ali Fayed got her on the bed and tried to get on top of her. His hands were ""inside my bra, inside my pants. I knew what his intention was"". According to Frances the alleged attack stopped when one of Ali's children called out for him. Afterwards, she says she sat on the bed, ""frozen"". A spokesperson for Ali Fayed said the businessman ""is not a perpetrator"" and will ""robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims"". When Frances returned to work in London, she says Mohamed Al Fayed ""exploded"" and started ""aggressively spitting abusive words"" because he apparently believed she and Ali had had sex . She says he told her: ""I'm done with you… go be with my brother."" ""From that point, I'd still see Mohamed, and he'd still call me every name under the sun, but he didn't actually physically abuse me,"" says Frances. ""Now I was in fear of two of the owners and I knew if I spoke out it would get worse. I could be threatened, I could be fired. I just felt I had to keep on going and, at some point, this horror would pass."" Frances says Ali Fayed sexually assaulted her again later that year on a trip to Balnagown, where she was adding the finishing interior touches to his farmhouse. Ali called her into his private office, she says, then dragged her onto his lap and started kissing her neck and touching her breasts as he spun around in his chair. She says she could feel he was aroused through his trousers. ""I remember him laughing,"" recalls Frances, who says she eventually managed to break free and run out of the room. ""Laughter is meant to be nice. It wasn't. I left him there just laughing at me."" Ali Fayed would often try to sexually touch her when they met, she says, ""always laughing and joking and making out it was fun"". The following year, Frances says she was fired for being in a relationship with another employee, something she says Mohamed Al Fayed forbade among staff. Harrods later settled a case she brought for unfair dismissal. Frances describes her time after leaving Harrods as ""going underground and shutting myself down"". She struggled to work and trust people and eventually moved away. She says Mohamed and Ali Fayed ""took away"" her confidence and dignity. ""To this day I suffer with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and I don't like people in my space,"" she says. Mohamed Al Fayed and his younger brothers bought Harrods in 1985. While Mohamed was the chairman, running day-to-day operations of the luxury department store, Ali Fayed was a director and also helped oversee the House of Fraser group, which they owned in the early 1990s. The new claims point to the ""breadth of abuse"" by Mohamed Al Fayed and ""raise serious allegations"" against his brother Ali, Harrods told the BBC in a statement. ""We could not possibly speak on behalf of any individual who can, and should, respond to these allegations directly,"" it added. The store, which came under new ownership in 2010, said it hoped survivors were looking at ""every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate"". Ali Fayed, who was granted British citizenship in 1999, co-owns luxury British shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser with his sons - but resigned as director on 8 December 2024, 10 days after these allegations were put to him by the BBC. All three women alleging abuse by Ali Fayed initially spoke to filmmaker Keaton Stone, who has been investigating Mohamed Al Fayed since 2018 and whose work informed the BBC's recent documentary and podcast about Mohamed's predatory behaviour. Mohamed Al Fayed never faced charges while he was alive, but the women believe his brother Ali should now be investigated by police. ""Whether any charges would be brought, I don't know, but I believe he should be investigated for what he did,"" says Amy. She worked as a personal assistant to Mohamed Al Fayed for almost three years, and says he sexually abused her throughout her time at Harrods. The abuse escalated, Amy says, when Mohamed let himself into her room on a work trip to Paris and tried to rape her. She says she ""endured"" the abuse, thinking ""that was just what being a young woman meant, it was a hazard of the workplace"". Amy says she remembers Ali Fayed coming into Mohamed's Park Lane office - and also taking phone calls from him. ""He gave me the nickname 'Amy speaking' which he thought was hilarious,"" she recalls. ""He would giggle when he spoke to me."" A year or two into the job, Amy says Mohamed told her to go to Switzerland with Ali to help with some personal assistant duties like filing and paperwork. The pair travelled together on a Harrods private jet, she says, and were driven to the upmarket resort of Gstaad, where the Fayed family owned a ski chalet. ""Once we got to the chalet, aside from the elderly housekeeper, it was myself and Ali alone for three days. It was strange,"" says Amy. ""No efforts were made to even create something for me to do."" The trip was taken out of season and Amy says Ali Fayed seemed bored. He suggested they go to the local public swimming pool, she says, and when they got there it was deserted. ""That's when Ali's demeanour changed and he became giddy,"" says Amy. ""He pulled me in under the water, and groped and fondled me, making me feel very, very uncomfortable - very much trapped. I was terrified thinking how am I going to get out of this."" Amy says Ali Fayed laughed as he ""groped"" her, before she managed to break free of his clutches. After the alleged assault, Amy says they both returned to the chalet and she was left alone for the rest of the evening, feeling isolated and afraid. Like the other two women, Amy didn't tell anyone about the alleged abuse by either of the brothers. Amy says she didn't want to upset her loved ones and didn't necessarily feel people would believe her. ""By not saying anything, I think it's a coping technique, to just put it away,"" she adds. Amy went back to work after the alleged assault took place in Gstaad, but eventually resigned. She says she ""escaped and ran away"" to work abroad. ""I wanted to just remove myself from it all"", she says, but ""the trauma"" lived with her. ""To this day, in certain social situations, I don't want to be noticed, I try to stay invisible,"" she says. Ali Fayed denies all the allegations of wrongdoing - said his spokesperson - and ""will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged"". A third woman, who we are calling Laura, told us she recalls Mohamed Al Fayed summoning her to his office and telling her ""with a smirk on his face"" that his brother Ali wanted to see her. ""I remember it vividly because I had no comprehension of who Ali was, I'd never even seen him,"" she says. ""I don't know how I was spotted or 'selected' for him."" Laura had been working directly for Mohamed Al Fayed in Harrods' HR department and says his sexual harassment towards her had become commonplace, escalating to two serious sexual assaults. Laura says Mohamed sent her to their office building in Park Lane one evening, but when she arrived there was no work to be done. She says she was sent through to Ali Fayed's apartment where he was waiting. Laura says he told her they would be having dinner, and then presented her with a bottle of wine from the year she was born and a necklace. ""I wondered how he knew things about me,"" she says. Alone in his apartment, Laura says Ali Fayed ordered her through to the bedroom where she says she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. She says she felt ""numbed with fear"" and had to do whatever she was told in order to ""get out of there"". ""Afterwards he just told me I could go."" Laura says she never saw Ali Fayed again but kept the necklace from that night and it has recently been valued at £6,500. The abuse at Harrods ""took its toll"" says Laura - even after she left the store. She bottled it all up for 25 years, she says, and still hasn't told some of her loved ones what she went through. All three women are pursuing civil legal action against Harrods through Justice for Harrods Survivors. ""We applaud the bravery of the women who have spoken out on their allegations against Ali Fayed and reiterate our commitment to securing justice and accountability for all survivors,"" says their barrister Maria Mulla. ""We repeat, no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of this aim."" The BBC spoke to three other women who said they had been either raped, sexually assaulted or trafficked by the other Fayed brother, Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010. The women who accuse Ali Fayed question what the three brothers knew about each other's behaviour. ""Looking back now, maybe they found it amusing to see how far the boundaries were with us between the brothers,"" says Amy. ""Maybe there was competition. I really don't know, but I do feel it was all amusing for them."" Ali Fayed's spokesperson says he ""unequivocally denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing. The alleged incidents simply never occurred. Mr Fayed is not a perpetrator and will not be scapegoated. He will robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims and will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged."" It is understood the Met Police has not recorded any allegations of sexual offending against Ali Fayed. A Met spokesperson told the BBC that the police force urged ""anyone with information, whether they were directly affected by Mohamed Al Fayed's actions or aware of others who may have been involved, or committed offences to come forward. ""We have specialist detectives who regularly handle sensitive cases and can provide survivors with access to support services. Every report will be carefully evaluated and recorded, and survivors are encouraged to use the secure channels provided to share their experiences."" Staff of ""certain races"" would leave shop floor before he toured the store, BBC told. The force is currently reviewing 21 allegations made before the former Harrods boss died in 2023. Harrods boss manipulated and controlled managers to conceal his crimes, ex-director tells the BBC.  The Metropolitan Police says it believes several people may have helped or enabled Mohamed Al Fayed's sexual offences.

The six-time Olympic cycling champion, 48, disclosed last year that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which had then become terminal with doctors giving him between two and four years to live. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, the former professional athlete said hearing of other men getting checked off the back of his announcement ""helps me make sense of my situation"". His latest project is a new cycling initiative, Tour de 4, aimed at challenging perceptions of people with cancer and raising money for cancer charities. Sir Chris said a friend in his mid-50s who had no symptoms and ""no previous issues at all"" would not have got a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test - which looks for signs of prostate cancer - if he had not made his own diagnosis public. ""Off the back of my diagnosis [he] went to his doctor, his doctor said 'you don't really need one' or 'there's no symptoms, come back when you've got any problems',"" he said.  ""And he pushed the issue and he had a test and he has prostate cancer. He's being treated and he caught it early, so he's doing really well. But if it had been left for another few years, who knows what might have happened."" When the 11-time world track cycling champion announced his diagnosis following a routine scan, it brought messages of praise and support from other British athletes and public figures. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said at the time that ""the whole country is behind him and his family"". Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men, with around one in eight in the UK being diagnosed with it in their lifetime. Sir Chris described the first few months after finding out as ""an emotional rollercoaster"", but said he had now ""got my head around it"". He added: ""When you find out a friend is in a similar situation, it's really difficult. But it has lifted me, it's given me a purpose."" BBC Breakfast also spoke to John Lee, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago after having no symptoms.  He said the Olympian's diagnosis may have saved his life. ""To have someone like that with that level of fitness and looking after themselves get prostate cancer, it suddenly occurred to me that I needed to get a test done,"" he said. Mr Lee added that his positive diagnosis had been ""devastating"", but that getting the test when he did meant it was ""caught in time"". Watching on, Sir Chris said: ""This is the kind of story - and there are quite a few of these that I've had via email or on social media - [that] makes sense of the situation. It's not in vain. It's not futile."" Sir Chris won six Olympic gold medals between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian - before retiring as an athlete in 2013. But he is still cycling - this time in preparation for the first Tour de 4 rally on 7 September for people affected by cancer, which will start and finish at the velodrome in Glasgow named after the Scot. ""I hope it's an uplifting event,"" he said. In the meantime, Sir Chris said he will be running several virtual bike rides with the likes of tennis star Andy Murray and other Olympic athletes that anyone can join, the first of which will take place on Saturday. The rural holiday retreat near Pickering will be a ""lifeline"" for those affected, they say. Eight-year-old Dulcie Dulcie was diagnosed with a stage four neuroblastoma in 2021. Hartlepool charity Miles for Men says it is cancelling this year's annual fun run. Scientists in Aberdeen say the scanner could make an extraordinary difference to diagnosis and treatment. Mini reactors could be built in hospital basements, guaranteeing diagnosis can go-ahead. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Mr Welby left the Church of England's most senior role in January after a damning report into a prolific child abuser associated with the Church. His replacement will be the 106th appointment to the role, the incumbent of which is the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Church. Historically, candidates already hold senior leadership positions in ministry in the Church or elsewhere in the Anglican Communion. They must be aged at least 30 and are generally younger than 70. Names can be submitted to the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC), the body charged with nominating the new archbishop. The Church said the consultation, which runs until 28 March, was ""an opportunity to gather the views of a wide range of people from across England and the Anglican Communion on the gifts, qualities and skills needed"" for the role. There will be no advert to which anyone can put their name forward to, with possible candidates instead ""invited in"" to the process. People can submit their views on the Church of England website. The 20-member CNC panel that will select the next Archbishop of Canterbury has yet to be formalised. For the first time it will include five members based in the Anglican Church abroad. It will meet in May, July and September to ""pray, reflect and nominate a candidate"" and the chosen individual will require the votes of two-thirds of the 17 voting members.  The name will then be given to the prime minster who will take it to the King for approval. Mr Welby resigned over the Church's handling of a sadistic abuser, John Smyth, who a report said had perpetrated brutal sexual, physical and mental abuse against more than 120 boys and young men since the late 1970s. The report said Mr Welby had ""personal and moral responsibility"" and that he ""could and should have done more"" in the case. After initially resisting calls to step down, he resigned on 12 November saying he was doing so ""in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse"". But in early December, abuse victims reacted with ""disgust"" at a short farewell speech Mr Welby gave at the House of Lords, in which he made jokes. Mr Welby apologised the following day. Before leaving the role he did not give a Christmas Day sermon at Canterbury Cathedral and did not broadcast a New Year's Day message, as he usually would through the BBC. The suspension of Rev Canon Alan Bashforth is after a complaint relating to a vulnerable adult. The sudden dropout is ""very unusual"", says editor of the Church Times Sarah Meyrick.  The Diocese of Portsmouth has set out its legal opposition to the Isle of Wight Council plans. The Glebe in Bayston Hill is owned by the church but was fenced off in November.

The ticket for the prize draw on 24 January worth £83,474,081.80 was purchased in the UK. The prize winner matched all five main numbers - 02, 11, 19, 30 and 49 - as well as the Lucky Star numbers, which were 03 and 08.  Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at National Lottery operator Allwyn, said it was ""absolutely incredible news"" that someone had come forward. Their claim needs to be verified before they receive a payout. ""Everyone dreams of that huge win when they buy their EuroMillions ticket - and for this lucky ticket-holder this dream has become a reality,"" he said, adding: ""Imagine all the possibilities that are now within their grasp."" Once the EuroMillions ticket has been validated and paid, the ticket-holder will then decide whether they wish to disclose their identity. Unless they decide to go public, there will be no information on where the ticket was purchased, nor whether they were an individual or syndicate winner, Allwyn said. The National Lottery said the jackpot was number 23 on their list of the ""most spectacular"" wins - ie the largest - of all time. In July 2022, an anonymous UK ticket-holder scooped the record EuroMillions jackpot of £195m.  That same year, Joe and Jess Thwaite, from Gloucester, won a then record-breaking £184,262,899 with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May. The UK's third biggest win came after an anonymous ticket-holder claimed the £177m jackpot in the draw in November last year. According to the National Lottery, there are still nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, with the largest standing at £1m. Ticket-holders have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize. The trust that runs the stately home and garden is facing a £7m bill to repair a water feature. A single ticket in the UK held the winning numbers for the Valentine's Day draw. Work can begin on the new centre after more than £2m in Lottery funding is secured. Almost £750,000 has been given to Coventry City Council for solar panels and lighting at the centres. The successful player matched all seven Valentine's Day numbers, the lottery operator said.

Currently, about 29 services travel on a weekday between the city and the Scottish capital, but that could drop to 17 if new timings go ahead.  The changes also include the loss of a peak time LNER service, which is popular with commuters to Newcastle. In a joint statement, LNER and Network Rail said while timetable changes ""may not satisfy everyone"", they would benefit ""the greatest number of customers across the north"". Currently about 15 LNER services to Edinburgh call at Durham every day, approximately one every hour. Under the plans the majority of these would be removed, although the BBC understands three will still stop at the city at 06:33, 07:49 and 22:49.  Peter Walker, from rail user group North East Coastliners, said the situation needed ""urgent attention and action"". ""Each hour's other service will call at Peterborough, Newark North Gate, Doncaster, York and Darlington but not Durham, whereas its equivalent in the current timetable does,"" Mr Walker said. ""As a result, Durham will, for most of the operating day, have no mainline LNER services to further north than Newcastle."" As part of the proposals, weekday services to London will increase from 19 to 22, and 21 trains will travel to Birmingham and Sheffield, up from 18. ""We recognise that timetable changes may not satisfy everyone, however the planned changes can be introduced reliably and will bring an additional six million seats on LNER services per year, provide faster services, and be of benefit to the greatest number of customers across the north,"" a spokesperson on behalf of LNER and Network Rail said.  The timetables are due to be finalised in the summer, with changes made from December. Weekday services to Newcastle will remain about the same at 63, slightly down from 66 currently.  However, some commuters have been concerned about the removal of a peak time LNER service to Edinburgh, which calls at Durham at 08:22 and arrives in Newcastle just after 08:30. It means there will be only two trains leaving the city for Newcastle between 08:00 and 09:00, with likely a total of seven carriages between them. Commuter Matthew Foskett has been breaking down the planned timetable changes and trying to raise awareness among passengers.  Mr Foskett, who travels to his workplace in Newcastle by train at least two days a week, hopes some of the proposals could be reconsidered. He said under the new plans there would be a 47-minute gap between arrivals in Newcastle almost every hour, ""which would really affect people"". ""If the service gets worse, you'll lose passengers, and we all know how busy the roads are, you don't want more people driving into Newcastle,"" he said. ""Sometimes I cycle to Newcastle, that takes an hour and 15 minutes. If there's a 45-minute gap in the trains and it takes 15 minutes on the train, it gets quite close, time wise.  ""I might as well cycle rather than getting the train, which is crazy."" A spokesperson on behalf of LNER and Network Rail said they had worked closely with other rail operators to ensure ""strong local and national connectivity"" in the planned timetable.

","A three-year time limit for child sexual abuse victims to sue for damages will be removed in England and Wales under ""long overdue"" government reforms, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said.  The MoJ said laws would also be refined to encourage employers to apologise for the actions of current or former employees, so victims would be more likely to receive apologies from institutions like schools, care facilities or hospitals. The government said it was delivering on recommendations laid out in the 2022 Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), led by Prof Alexis Jay. The reforms are expected to be part of bills to be brought before Parliament in the next year. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the changes recommended by Prof Jay were ""long overdue"".  ""These measures help survivors pursue their path to justice,"" she added.  Prof Jay had called for an end to the deadline for victims to bring compensation claims. At present, civil child sexual abuse claims must be brought within three years of turning 18, unless the victim can prove a fair trial can proceed despite the time lapse.  However, the IICSA reported that a ""significant number"" of claims were being rejected because it could take ""decades for survivors to feel able to discuss their sexual abuse"". Mahmood told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that the government had ""inherited a situation"" in which Prof Jay's recommendations had not been actioned, adding her department was ""moving at pace"" to implement the suggestions. Change is expected beyond the MoJ, Mahmood added, saying that other government departments mentioned in Prof Jay's recommendations will announce reforms ""in due course"". Kim Harrison, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said the three-year deadline was ""wholly inappropriate"".   ""It will now be the burden of defendants to prove that the passage of time has created an unfair trial, rather than on the victim or survivor to prove a fair trial is possible,"" she said.  Last month, the government confirmed it would introduce a mandatory reporting duty for those working with children to report sexual abuse as part of the Crime and Policing Bill.  Criminal sanctions will be introduced for both the concealment of, and failure to report, child sexual abuse. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has also promised to make grooming an aggravated factor in the sentencing of abuse cases and ""overhaul"" how information and evidence on child sexual abuse is gathered. The long wait for the IICSA recommendations to be implemented was thrown into the spotlight in January after tech billionaire Elon Musk attacked the government online in relation to child grooming. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused him and others of ""spreading lies and misinformation"", but weeks later the Home Office announced a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries. At the time Cooper said the government would lay out a timetable by Easter for implementing the recommendations in the final report. The row between Mr Musk and Sir Keir centred on high-profile cases where groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - were convicted of sexually abusing and raping predominantly young white girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale. Before leading the national inquiry Prof Jay published a report into abuse in Rotherham in 2014, which estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in the Yorkshire town. They are urging MPs to work together to ensure a much-delayed plan to tackle grooming gangs is put into action. Emily Vaughn has accused presiding officer Elin Jones of ""downplaying"" her experience in the Senedd. Alan Edwards says the debate surrounding grooming gangs takes attention away from the victims. Some survivors say their voices have not been heard after an inflammatory intervention by Elon Musk. The Tory leader has been calling for a fresh inquiry into grooming gangs. Copyright 2025 BBC.

Company founder Justine Roberts told the BBC the ""horrific incident"" had been reported to police after the images were posted on the platform over several hours late on Sunday. It has now suspended the facility to post pictures on the site as a temporary measure and is planning to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) filters to flag ""illegal"" and ""disturbing"" images before they appear. Some Mumsnet users have raised concerns about the length of time the images were visible and the site's use of volunteer moderators during overnight hours in the UK. In a thread on Mumsnet following the incident, one user said it was ""time to rethink"" the volunteer moderation system following ""the truly awful photos... which I will never un-see"". ""The site is big enough and money-making enough to support a better system by now,"" the user added. ""There really needs to be proper 24-hour IT cover."" Ms Roberts defended the use of volunteer moderators overnight, saying they were based overseas in different time zones ""so they can easily monitor the site"". ""I don't believe this horrible incident would have been prevented had it happened in office hours with our usual moderation team in London,"" she said. ""The key is to stop this type of horrific thing being posted on our site in the first place and we're putting all our efforts into preventing that from happening again."" ""Several sets"" of child abuse images were posted on Mumsnet between 23:00 GMT on Sunday and 03:00 on Monday, Ms Roberts said.  Most of the images were removed within an hour of being posted and all were taken down by 04:00 on Monday, she added. Ms Roberts said it was ""pretty clear"" there was an ""ongoing, co-ordinated effort to further inflame the conversation on (the) site around the issue and to cause as much disruption as possible"". She added that Mumsnet was looking into ""further tools"" that could help prevent future similar incidents. The company is due to meet the Metropolitan Police after reporting the incident on Monday, Ms Roberts said. A Met spokesperson told the BBC it was investigating and no arrests have been made. The spokesperson added that ""we completely understand this is incredibly distressing"" and urged anyone who saw the images and has not yet spoken to police to contact the force. Ms Roberts said Mumsnet was ""regularly subject to threats and attacks from people who seem to want to derail the conversation on site"". ""This latest horrific incident feels like another attempt to do the same,"" she added. ""Over the years we've been swatted [fake calls to the police], attacked by bots and suffered bomb threats amongst other things. ""Right now our team is very focused on preventing any further such horrific images ever appearing on site and helping the police in their attempts to find the person or persons who posted them."" Ms Roberts said moderators who viewed the images of child abuse have been offered support. Mumsnet was founded by Ms Roberts in 2000 as an internet forum for parents to swap advice. It says it now has around nine million unique users per month. The force deals with more than 70 child sex cases a month and expects that figure to double next year.  Telford and Wrekin Council's leader says the issue has not been eradicated, but children are safer. 'Disappearing messages' on Snapchat criticised by campaigner, as charity calls for politicians and social media companies to do more.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y28ny1n0o,2025-02-04T17:09:49.379Z,Sean Seddon,Why are medical experts disputing evidence used to convict Lucy Letby? ,Convicted serial killer Lucy Letby is back in the news after a panel of medical experts working with her defence team said they believe the 35-year-old did not commit the murders.,"Convicted serial killer Lucy Letby is back in the news after a panel of medical experts working with her defence team said they believe the 35-year-old did not commit the murders. The case against the former nurse has been extremely complex from the outset - not least because nobody saw Letby attack the seven babies she was convicted of murdering, nor did anyone witness the attempted murder of seven others. Instead, prosecutors had to draw on technical medical evidence - along with statistical data and other troubling details about Letby's life - in order to prove their case. She was found guilty by a jury and given 15 whole life sentences. Senior judges have twice rejected her efforts to overturn her convictions - but a new report claims Letby is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Fourteen senior clinicians from around the world have analysed the medical evidence against Letby, including British doctor Neena Modi, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The panel was assembled by Dr Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian doctor based at the University of Toronto who specialises in the treatment of young children. He said the panel worked without payment and were not familiar with the case prior to reviewing the evidence. Dr Lee became involved with Letby's defence after being made aware that prosecutors had used a 1989 academic paper he co-authored as part of their case. That paper focused on how air embolisms could lead to a baby's skin becoming discoloured. It was relevant because prosecutors successfully argued that Letby attacked some of her victims by injecting air into them, causing a fatal embolism. Dr Lee has accused the prosecution of misinterpreting his research and he has since published an update discounting a link between marks on the skin and air embolisms.  Last year, he offered to give evidence on behalf of Letby during her appeal and to say, in effect, that his research had been misused by the prosecution. However, three senior judges decided Dr Lee's submission should not be considered by the court on the grounds, they said, that the prosecution had not at any point relied solely on evidence of skin discolouration to diagnose an embolism. The new report goes beyond the embolism question Dr Lee has spoken out on previously. BBC News has only seen a summary as a full copy has not been made publicly available.  On Tuesday, Dr Lee said the panel believed all of Letby's victims actually died of natural causes or because of poor medical care. ""There was no medical evidence to support malfeasance causing death or injury,"" he told a news conference, before listing what he alleged were a number of wider failings at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit where Letby worked. The report deals with the cases of all 14 babies in turn.  In one case in which Letby was convicted of killing a baby by injecting air into its stomach, the panel said their analysis indicated a cause of death arising from natural respiratory complications and chronic lung disease.  Additionally, they said doctors had failed to detect a bacterial illness and should have prescribed antibiotics. In a case where Letby was convicted of attacking a baby by removing a tube which was allowing the infant to breathe, Dr Lee said the panel's analysis suggests the infant collapsed because it was fitted with the wrong size tube in the first place by a consultant who ""didn't know what he was doing"". There are similar findings for all Letby's victims: the panel said all the deaths could be explained by natural causes or medical errors. However, the criminal case against Letby did not exclusively rely on medical evidence.  Prosecutors also pointed to data showing she was on shift when babies fell ill, as well as circumstantial evidence - including the fact she repeatedly researched the families of the deceased and kept records which a judge said were ""morbid records"" of her crimes. Speaking at Tuesday's news conference, Mark McDonald - the barrister leading Letby's defence - argued the circumstantial evidence was of ""lesser"" importance in the case against the nurse compared to the medical evidence. Letby's two previous failed attempts to appeal mean she cannot simply lodge another. Instead, her defence team are attempting to use another route to get a judge to re-examine the case. They have submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent public body which examines potential miscarriages of justice. The CCRC cannot decide whether someone is innocent or guilty but it can refer a case back to the Court of Appeal if it decides that there is a real possibility someone has wrongly been found guilty. Letby's legal team will need to show that they have uncovered compelling new evidence indicating that she could be innocent in order to get the case back into court. That, they say, is what Dr Lee's findings constitute. However, it will ultimately be up to the CCRC - and potentially the appeal court - to determine whether that is the case. The medical evidence against Letby was analysed in depth during her trial and it could be decided that the panel's arguments were already fully considered and dismissed. On Tuesday, the CCRC said it had received a ""preliminary application"" from Letby's lawyers. Dr Lee said he would not be providing Letby's legal team with his full report until the end of the month, so it could still be some time before the CCRC reaches a decision. Dr Dewi Evans - who was the prosecution's main medical expert - rejected the suggestion that Dr Lee's 1989 paper had been a critical part of the case against Letby. Speaking before a summary of the panel's findings were published, Dr Evans told the Sunday Times the research was ""not a major factor in the prosecution case"". He went on: ""What the prosecution stated was that some of these babies, as part of their collapse, had a skin discolouration which has been described in Dr Lee's paper in 1989, but — and it's an important but — the presence or absence of skin discolourations neither ruled out nor confirmed air embolism. It was not necessary. ""It's a useful paper — I don't want to do it down — but comparing how babies responded to treatment in the 1980s to how they respond to treatment in 2015, it's different.""  A public inquiry led by Lady Justice Thirlwall is investigating the Countess of Chester Hospital's response to the deaths. She has been highly critical of people who have cast doubt on the verdicts, saying it causes ""enormous additional distress to the parents"". The case has also inspired what one KC barrister has described as a ""proliferation of conspiracy theories"" online. Dr Lee's intervention is not the first time experts have raised concerns about Letby's conviction: a group of 24 neonatal experts pushed for the public inquiry to be delayed because they believed ""alternative, potentially complex causes"" for the deaths were not examined and ""important lessons"" were missed. The BBC has also previously spoken to experts who have raised doubts about some of the evidence used to convict Letby. However, none went as far to say as they thought she could be innocent.

Rather than a formal entrance in a royal car, the princess stepped off the minibus holding hands with a little girl as the school trip arrived at the National Portrait Gallery.  The head teacher said the royal helper had been ""really chatty"" with the children on the bus, playing I-spy with them and helping with their jumpers.

""She was wonderful, so relaxed with the children, really chatty. Children were so engaged with her, playing I-spy with her at one point and helping with jumpers,"" said the head teacher. Catherine, who held hands with a girl called Grace during the visit by the reception class, helped children as they drew their own portraits in a gallery filled with pictures of famous faces. The gallery, which has Catherine as its royal patron, has opened an interactive, storytelling trail for young children, with activities encouraging them to think about their emotions as they create their own self-portrait. Catherine's Shaping Us initiative emphasises the importance of the first five years of children's lives - and the latest stage of the project calls for a greater emphasis on teaching social skills and improving mental health. The free exhibition for children at the National Portrait Gallery picks up on the themes about understanding emotions. Liz Smith, the gallery's director of learning, said children could be the ""harshest critics"" but they had responded well to the project. The gallery visit is another part of Catherine's gradual return to work after completing her cancer treatment. She marked World Cancer Day by releasing a photo taken of her by her six-year-old son Prince Louis. The princess, who revealed last month that she is in remission from cancer, has been calling for a ""rebalance"" in society to encourage people to show more compassion and empathy. King Charles is continuing his cancer treatment and the Royal Family's social media channel had a message ""sending love to all those navigating a cancer diagnosis – as well as the incredible doctors, nurses, charities and families who work tirelessly to support them"".

","Vogue editor Dame Anna Wintour has ""firmly"" told King Charles she will not stop working, as she removed her signature sunglasses to receive an award at Buckingham Palace.  Dame Anna, the longest-serving editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was made Companion of Honour for her services to fashion.  She was honoured in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours and joins the likes of Dame Judi Dench, Sir Elton John, David Hockney and Sir Paul McCartney in the select group. ""It makes me even more convinced that I have so much more to achieve,"" she said.  Dressed in Alexander McQueen, Dame Anna told reporters on Tuesday she was ""completely surprised and overwhelmed"" to receive her second accolade at Buckingham Palace. She was made a dame in 2017 by Queen Elizabeth II, who honoured her for her contribution to fashion and journalism.  ""The last time I was here the Queen gave me a medal and we both agreed that we had been doing our job a very long time, and then this morning His Majesty asked me if this meant I was going to stop working and I said firmly, no,"" she said. Last month, she also went without her trademark shades as former US President Joe Biden presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom - America's highest civilian honour - at the White House. The 75-year-old previously told the BBC the glasses are a ""prop"". ""They help me be seen and not be seen,"" she said. One of the most significant players in fashion, Dame Anna has been editor-in-chief of Vogue since 1988 and, among other charities, has helped raise more than $20m (£16m) for Aids research. She has organised annual fundraiser the Met Gala, in New York, since 1995 and has also raised money for UK arts organisations following funding cuts in 2022. The Order of the Companions of Honour is an exclusive group, limited to 65 people at any one time.  Appointments go to those who have made a long-standing contribution to the arts, science, medicine or government. Tracey Emin, 61, one of Britain's most acclaimed artists, was also honoured at the investiture ceremony on Tuesday as she was made a dame. Speaking afterwards, she said her 2020 bladder cancer diagnosis had made her focus on ""helping other people"".  In March 2023 her Tracey Emin Foundation opened its doors in Margate, offering rent-free space to art students.  ""I think if you come from an impoverished background, it's almost impossible to even get your qualifications and get into university,"" said Dame Tracey. ""But one thing I would say is: do not be put off by the fees. ""Go to university and worry about it afterwards, because otherwise, if you don't have the education, you can't change anything."" Her notable works include My Bed, an art installation at the Tate Gallery exhibiting her own unmade bed and a floor littered with empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and condoms.  The work, shortlisted for the 1999 Turner prize, sold at auction for £2.2m. Tickets will be available for tours of St James's Palace in April and May at a cost of £85.

It means the 19:15 GMT Manxman sailing to Heysham on Friday and Saturday along with the 01:45 return on Saturday and Sunday have been called off. The company said it had hoped that conditions within Heysham port would ""improve sufficiently to allow sailings to go ahead as planned"". While the firm said it ""deeply regrets"" having to make the alterations, it stressed that in order to stay within the company's safety criteria, the move was ""necessary"", according to a statement from the operator. Other changes to the schedule will see Tuesday evening's 19:15 GMT crossing to Heysham depart at 20:30, with her return on Wednesday pushed back to 03:00. Wednesday's 08:00 GMT crossing from Douglas will leave at 08:45, with her return now scheduled for 14:30. The 20:00 GMT crossing on Wednesday will now leave at 19:15 with no changes made to the return crossing.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk521rrxyo,2025-02-04T06:03:06.818Z,Shona Elliott and Ruth Clegg,Celebrity butt-lift injector who left women with sepsis exposed by BBC,"A self-styled ""beauty consultant"", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.","A self-styled ""beauty consultant"", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered. Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger. BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death). One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather ""have died"" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment. Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas. Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient. He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose. Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing £1,200. We paid a £200 deposit. Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an ""ultrasound specialist doctor"", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection. Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. ""You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,"" he suggested. By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of £2,000. We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter. Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were ""shocking"", ""very dangerous"", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications. ""Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,"" said Mr Humzah. ""The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death."" The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures. Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment. One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment. Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her. All she wanted, she says, was a ""peachy bum"". But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts. She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate. In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a ""dingy little hallway"" for about half an hour. ""I should have turned and ran,"" she says, ""but I had paid £600 deposit and travelled all this way."" She was taken into a small room where there ""was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop"", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer. After counting out the rest of her cash - £2,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool. As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable. ""I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,"" she says. ""I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood."" By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: ""I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured."" She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk. ""I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics."" By this point, sepsis had begun to set in. ""My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,"" says Joanne. ""I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming."" In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly. After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account. Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation. Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery. Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital. She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: ""Mum, I think I'm going to die."" Louise had developed sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock. Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton. ""How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?"" she told the BBC. However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable. Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened. A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.  BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate. From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising. Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped. In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer. Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer. All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement. ""We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,"" she says. ""Some have, and nothing has been done."" So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury. But ""he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on"", says Ms Collins. We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was ""urgently looking at options for tougher regulation"". It said our findings were ""shocking"" and that those caught ""dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law"". We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic. As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it. We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care. ""No,"" he said - and told us to leave. The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins. ""The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault."" It is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: ""People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.""

The image shows Catherine in a frosty woodland scene, arms open and well wrapped up, and was taken in Windsor in recent weeks. Alongside the photo, the princess posted the words: ""Don't forget to nurture all that which lies beyond the disease."" The picture is said by Kensington Palace to reflect how spending time in nature has been important to the princess, who announced in January she is in remission from cancer. This is the first photo taken by Louis that has been shared on royal social media channels as he follows in the footsteps of his mother, who has been an enthusiastic photographer. At the weekend, Catherine called for a ""rebalance"" in society to allow people to prioritise their physical and mental health. She is gradually returning to work after completing her cancer treatment - and launched a new stage in her early years education project encouraging more empathy and kindness. ""At times, it can feel like the world is filled with mistrust and misunderstanding, leaving many people feeling isolated and vulnerable during difficult times,"" she wrote in her charity's report. She brought a message of support for those currently undergoing cancer treatment when last month she visited the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London, where she had been a patient. This latest photograph is another indication of her continuing support, ahead of World Cancer Day, and how much she seems to have been motivated to help others by her own experience of ill health.

From Monday, those convicted of the crime and sentenced to 12 months or more will automatically be managed under multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa). Under Mappa, the police, probation, prison services and other agencies are legally required to work together to better manage the risks posed by the offenders. For the first time, it puts controlling or coercive behaviour on a par with other domestic abuse offences, including threats to kill and stalking, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. Agencies are legally required under Mappa to share any information which indicates an increased risk to former partners and members of the public.  Offenders managed under the scheme have a reoffending rate less than half of the national average, according to the MoJ. Coercive control is a psychological type of domestic abuse where the perpetrator uses threats, humiliation and intimidation to harm and frighten the victim. Over a period of time, this can isolate the victim and deprive them of their independence. It is often seen alongside other forms of domestic abuse, and has been a criminal offence in the UK since 2015. Samantha Billingham was in a controlling and abusive relationship where she said she ""lost her sense of identity, belonging and purpose"". She said coercive control had a ""huge effect"" on her life even after leaving the relationship, and she lost the ability to trust people including long-term friends. Ms Billingham said the tougher management of offenders was ""a step in the right direction"" but added: ""I don't feel it's enough alone. ""Survivors must be believed and taken seriously when reporting coercive control.  ""Education is key and awareness is power - we need it in all schools, colleges and universities. We need our young people to know the early warning signs and what coercive control is."" A change in the law around the management of people convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour was introduced in the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 by the previous government, and comes into force on Monday. Before this, those convicted could only be actively managed on a discretionary basis. The law change applies to offenders sentenced to at least 12 months' imprisonment, including suspended sentences, or those given a hospital order for an offence of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: ""For the first time, under this change to the law, coercive or controlling behaviour is being placed where it belongs – on a par with serious violent offending."" Women's Aid said it welcomed plans to treat the crime ""seriously"". The charity's chief executive Farah Nazeer said coercive control was a ""key tool used by perpetrators of domestic abuse, as it isolates survivors and makes them dependent on an abuser"". She added that it was ""essential"" for specialist domestic abuse services to be routinely included in the Mappa process ""if survivors are to be properly protected by this measure"".

Last year, changes were brought in that meant people coming to Australia on a working holiday visa no longer had to do 88 days of rural farm work and the age limit of the visas went up from 30 to 35. It meant 16 million more British citizens became eligible to apply for a visa and several young people in their 20s and 30s have spoken to the BBC about making the switch from the Channel Islands. They have said the weather, the city life and the active nature of Australia's sporting community has been a big draw for them. Lauren Lowe works in the health sector and made the move to Australia from Jersey a year ago. She said: ""I never worked or lived abroad"" so ""it was time to try something new"" and ""I wanted to challenge myself and move all the way across the world"". Ms Lowe added: ""There's definitely been some highs and there's been lows as it was a very stressful coming here with no fixed job and nowhere to live."" But she also said: ""I've always been quite sporty and outdoorsy, so I think the opportunities here have been really fantastic and it's definitely outweighed the challenges that we had when we first arrived."" Megan Chapple works in finance and also made the move just over a year ago. She said: ""I've moved mainly for the weather"" and ""Australia is a good place because you've got a good economy and good training grounds for triathlons"", which she has competed in at a high level. ""Me and my partner just came with two suitcases and started from scratch and obviously missing family and friends has probably got to be the biggest sacrifice that you make,"" Ms Chapple added. She also said she was ""constantly battling"" to speak to family because of the time difference but added: ""I think I'll be here at least for the next few years"" because ""while I'm on this side of the hemisphere - I hope to make sure I go to as many places in Asia and see more of New Zealand as possible"". Sarah Friss, however, is from Brisbane and made the move to Jersey nine years ago. She said: ""I get that the weather, especially at this time of year, makes living in Australia very tempting,"" and: ""You don't have to do those months of farm work any more so I suspect this trend will continue because it is a great place to live."" Ms Friss moved to the island after finding a teaching job and added she had got ""a nice group of friends and I like the fact that it's small and quiet but still close enough to Europe and London so that I can go travelling easier than I could back home"". She added ""I feel at home here because the people are nice and friendly and with the beaches nearby - there is a similar vibe but not so much with the weather.""

The Minister for Health and Social Services has designated St Ann's Hospital in Dorset as an ""approved establishment"" for islanders to receive the specialised service which cannot be provided locally.

Smyth, who died in 2018, used horrific violence to attack boys at his Winchester home in the 1970s and 1980s, the Makin Review into his abuse found. Justin Welby, who stepped down as Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year because of the scandal, is among several senior figures not facing action because of ""insufficient evidence"" for disciplinary proceedings. Also not facing action but coming under criticism in the Makin Review are four serving bishops - the current Bishop of Lincoln Stephen Conway, Bishop of Episcopal Ministry in the Anglican Communion Jo Bailey Wells, Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Martin Seeley and the Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba. A survivor of Smyth's abuse told the BBC he was relieved that some were ""at long last"" being held to account for their failings but said he was surprised others had not been named. The long-awaited report was released in November and detailed ""the prolific, brutal and horrific"" abuse perpetrated against more than 120 boys and young men by Smyth at Christian camps from the late 1970s in England until his death in South Africa in 2018. That review led to the resignation of Justin Welby for what he acknowledged was his ""personal and institutional responsibility"". The Church's National Safeguarding Team has since reviewed the evidence against nearly 40 other active clergy criticised in the report, deciding that some of it meets the threshold for further action. Those who are facing disciplinary proceedings by the Church of England are accused in the report of various degrees of failing to act during the timeline of Smyth's abuse.  The report said former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey had been informed of the abuse in an outline of a report in 1983 which ""contained enough information about abuses to signal a need for action regarding John Smyth"". Lord Carey denied seeing it and told the review he did not know Smyth when he studied at Trinity Theological College when Lord Carey was principal. Makin said that ""seems highly unlikely"" given Smyth's public prominence at the time. He gave up his ""permission to officiate"" in December following a BBC investigation into the Church of England's handling of a separate sexual abuse case. Another priest that now faces disciplinary action is Canon Andrew Cornes, a retired clergyman from the Chichester diocese who was due to be a member of the Crown Nominations Commission that will appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury. The Makin review said Rev Cornes was told in 1982 by a victim of Smyth about abuse he suffered. It said there was ""no evidence to suggest that Andrew Cornes took action to respond to this, he suggests that he thought that the matter was being dealt with"". The Church of England has clarified that Rev Cornes has ""voluntary stepped back from ministry pending the outcome of this process and will not be participating in the Crown Nominations Commission"". The full list of clergy to face disciplinary action includes: Because of the length of time after their alleged failures to act took place, the initiation of the disciplinary process for each needs to be approved by the Church's President of Tribunals.  Given the vulnerability of the victims involved, it is understood they are likely to proceed. The so-called clergy disciplinary measure process could lead to anyone found guilty being prohibited from exercising church ministry for life. Mark Stibbe was groomed and brutally beaten by Smyth after joining his school's Christian Forum in 1977 and has waited decades for justice. Mr Stibbe said he was ""relieved"" those identified in the review would be ""held to account for their failings"". ""I, along with my fellow Smyth survivors, wait with keen interest to see whether any disciplinary measures are enforced,"" he said. ""I am surprised that those senior clergy who in 2013 knew the full extent of Smyth's abuses, and who did not properly ensure that Smyth was brought to justice, are not named in the list released today,"" he added.  ""Nevertheless, it's good to know that after all these years not only the truth is being discovered but that justice is being done"". Alexander Kubeyinje, the Church of England's national director of safeguarding, said survivors and victims had endured lifelong effects from Smyth's ""appalling abuse"". ""We have announced next steps in the process looking at both risk and disciplinary processes,"" he added. Smyth had also worked as a barrister representing morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse whilst he ran the camps for young evangelical Christians. Reports of his physical abuse of boys were first revealed in an investigation by Channel 4 News, in February 2017. Smyth and his wife Anne were excommunicated by his local church in Cape Town, South Africa, the year before he died.

Ryan Castellucci previously lost a High Court challenge to have their gender recorded as non-binary on a gender recognition certificate - a document which changes someone's legal sex - after moving to the UK in 2019. They had obtained legal recognition as non-binary in California in 2021, and were issued an American passport in 2022 listing their sex as 'X'.  Dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Singh said the issue was ""potentially controversial"" and was ""better suited to resolution in Parliament than the courts"". At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Castellucci, a cyber security expert who moved to the UK from California, uses the title ""Mx"" and refers to themselves using they/them pronouns.  While they have undergone surgery and hormone treatment, they told the court they continue to use the name Ryan as it is considered unisex in the US. Castellucci described the experience of trying to obtain legal documents listing them as non-binary as an ""ordeal"" and the court heard they worried about possible difficulties related to their gender identity when applying for British citizenship. They also raised concerns about how their gender identity would be reflected on their death certificate, when their US documents state they are non-binary. Lord Justice Singh, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Sir Andrew McFarlane, said that only 11 countries worldwide, as well as some US states including California, recognise non-binary gender in law. Non-binary is an umbrella term for those those who do not identify as exclusively male or female.  In a judgment published on Tuesday, Lord Justice Singh said: ""The concept of 'gender' in the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), when referred to in the context of the domestic law route, is confined to two genders."" He added that, at an earlier appeal in 2023, the government said ""no changes were currently needed and more research and consultation would be needed before any changes were contemplated"". He continued: ""There is no general consensus, either in the Council of Europe or more generally around the world, in favour of recognising non-binary status. ""Furthermore, this is an area of social policy which is highly sensitive and potentially controversial, thereby being better suited to resolution in Parliament rather than in the courts. ""This is not only for reasons of democratic legitimacy but also for reasons of institutional competence."" Anna Dews, associate solicitor at Leigh Day, the firm which represented Castellucci, said they were considering appealing the ruling. She said: ""Ryan's only registered gender is non-binary. Despite Parliament legislating for the UK to recognise foreign-acquired genders, the courts have so far ruled that non-binary foreign genders do not count.  ""Ryan considers that there cannot be true gender equality without recognition of the fact that not all genders are binary."" Copyright 2025 BBC.

The UK Department for Transport has committed up to £5m towards the project with that sum matched by the Scottish government.  The funding had previously been agreed through the Borderlands Growth Deal but the new UK Labour government wanted to carry out a spending review before releasing its share. It paves the way to appoint a project manager to assess the ""benefits and challenges"" of extending the line beyond Tweedbank and on to Carlisle. The news comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the opening of the line between Edinburgh and the Borders later this year. Both the Scottish and UK governments agreed in 2021 to provide £10m towards exploring the feasibility of progressing the line from Tweedbank to Carlisle. However, it has taken four years for the funding package to be finally unlocked. UK government Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: ""It's great news that the UK Department for Transport has now confirmed up to £5m towards feasibility work to explore the potential to extend the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Carlisle. ""We look forward to working with deal partners as the feasibility work progresses."" Scotland's Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government remained committed to providing £5m towards taking the project forward. ""We welcome the news that the UK government will now match our commitment of up to £5m for a feasibility study to extend the Borders Railway and are supportive of partners securing a project manager with the technical expertise to deliver the project well,"" she said. Rail Minister Lord Hendy added: ""I'm pleased to commit to the progression of the Borders Railway extension, which would open up the route for more people to explore the region's picturesque landscapes and rich heritage, and I look forward to seeing how the proposal develops."" Scottish Borders Council leader Euan Jardine said they were making ""significant strides"" towards the extension of the line. ""We have already seen the positive impact the Waverley line has brought to the Borders,"" he said. ""This collaborative effort demonstrates the power of partnership in driving positive change and transforming our region for the better.""

The charity told the BBC ""an organisation-wide consultation"" has begun and said that ""hard-won rights are being rolled back for marginalised communities across the world"".   Only roles with dedicated funding would be safe, Stonewall's CEO Simon Blake told staff in a call on Thursday. When asked by the BBC how much foreign aid spending cuts related to their decision, Stonewall said there are ""a number of reasons for the consultation"". Stonewall has 114 employees, according to the UK charity commission website. The charity's largest funder in recent years has been the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which is overseen by the US state department. It has given Stonewall more than £500,000 between 2021 and 2025. Stonewall's accounts show the GEF granted it £137,254 in 2021-22, £204,442 in 2022-23 and £233,583 in 2023-24. The GEF is a pooled fund from several countries and private business, with a focus on ""advancing LGBTI rights around the world"". But, according to the Times, it has not published accounts since 2015. President Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought in line with his ""America First"" strategy. The US government has announced a freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a ""review"" to ensure they align with Trump's priorities. Mr Blake warned about the impact that Trump's policies would have on Stonewall and LGBTQ+ rights globally. ""The work to advocate for LGBTQ+ equality has never been more important and Stonewall is rising to meet the challenge,"" Stonewall said in a statement to the BBC.  ""We are seeing an unprecedented political backlash against the principles of inclusion. Stonewall is adapting to ensure that it is fit for purpose and able to meet the challenges of this new political era."" The statement added that ""many charities in the UK are facing tough choices for a range of reasons, including the economic environment. Stonewall is no different"". The charity also said that its work in eastern Europe is ""a good example of the type of project that may cease if funding isn't replaced"". Stonewall's projects in eastern Europe help communities and law enforcement agencies to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ violence and provide ""vital services to victims"", according to Mr Blake.

","A man who experienced a ""challenging"" marriage proposal with his now-fiancée in Jersey due to ferry cancellations and access restrictions says it was ""worth it"".  Simon Tite, 42, from Coventry, planned to propose to partner Emma Francis, 39, at Plemont Bay on Saturday for their sixth anniversary.  But Mr Tite said strong winds led to the cancellation of a ferry from Poole in Dorset and repair work meant they were unable to access his desired beach for the proposal. However, after success when he popped the question on board a boat, he said: ""It couldn't have been any better. Despite the fact it was challenging to get there, it was 100,000% worth it."" Mr Tite said Plemont was Miss Francis's ""favourite place in the world"". He said the pair drove to Poole on Thursday with the intention of catching the Condor Ferry on Friday. He said: ""We got to Poole and all the ferries were cancelled because of the weather. ""I was like: 'I do not believe this'. ""I desperately booked flights for us to come on the Friday from Southampton."" Mr Tite said the proposal plans were met with another obstacle after he discovered access to the preferred beach was blocked off due to repair work.  He said he contacted the government's infrastructure department to see if it would allow them to access the beach to walk on it. Officials said no due to safety reasons.  Mr Tite said he then arranged a boat ride for the proposal, adding he planned for the pair to swim into the bay He said he hired wetsuits but the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) company said there ""was no way"" the pair could get into the water due to the strong winds. Mr Tite said: ""The wind and the waves were just amazingly massive."" He then popped the question on board the RIB at sea. Miss Francis said: ""I had a face like thunder because I'd been told, in February: 'You're gonna put a wetsuit on. ""Every turn it was: 'Oh, we're not doing this now.' ""I didn't know what was happening at all."" However, despite that the ""bizarre"" experience and eventually realising what was happening, Mrs Tite-to-be said the location was ""perfect"".

Milk production firm Arla said it planned to close its Settle site by the end of 2026, putting 128 roles there under threat. The company, which is headquartered in Leeds, plans to move more of its operations to its Lockerbie site in Scotland, including some that are currently based in Stourton, Leeds. Deanne Ferguson from the GMB union said the closure would be ""a devastating blow for the dedicated workers at Settle and for the local community which relies on this key employer"". Arla Foods' vice president of production, Fran Ball, said the company would be entering into a period of consultation with its employees over the plans. Ms Ball said the proposals ""form part of our strategy to strengthen our manufacturing network and futureproof dairy production in the UK"". An Arla spokesperson said it ""remains committed to being a major employer in the Yorkshire region"". The spokesperson said more than 1,000 people were employed in Leeds, including about 500 people at the company's headquarters in Leeds Valley Park and a further 450 people at its dairy in Stourton. No jobs were under threat in Leeds, they added, although about 24 roles would be impacted due to the changes. Last year the company invested £65m investment in its Stourton site, according to the spokesperson. The company said it planned to invest almost £90m into its Lockerbie site, creating 90 new jobs. The plans include creating a UHT milk ""centre of excellence"". UHT and lacto-free milk is currently produced in Settle. Ms Ferguson said the closure would have ""a significant economic and social impact"". ""We will now begin urgent discussions with Arla to explore all possible options to protect jobs.
