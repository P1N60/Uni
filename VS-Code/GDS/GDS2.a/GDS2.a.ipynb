       "['Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.  Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded. This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.   The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on \"a foreign army\"  that he said was operating in the east. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23. He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.  \"There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.  It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu\\'s main square. In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects. \"This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,\" he said.  The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.  The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year\\'s internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the L√©on Th√©venin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I\\'m a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L√©on Th√©venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren\\'t in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it\\'s accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L√©on Th√©venin\\'s deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year. Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor\\'s widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was \"proud\" of her husband\\'s impact at the BBC, and also said her family were \"thankful to the BBC for remembering him\" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent. As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC\\'s global audiences. Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world. The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences. Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year\\'s winner. During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith. Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: \"We are proud to launch this year\\'s BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.  \"Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor\\'s powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.  \"Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year\\'s winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply.\" Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC\\'s first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service. He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News\\' European morning segment. He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award. Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme. In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa\\'s top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent. In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine\\'s list of the 100 most influential Africans. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " '\"I swear to God I need help,\" said the man quietly on the other end of the line. The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country\\'s border with Thailand. They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.  The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people ‚Äì more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough. The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten. He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could. Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills. Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses. \"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\" Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.  Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money. China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border. Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October. He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss. \"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\" Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.  He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife\\'s jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls. The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.  It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business. That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds. The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.  Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border. Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.  A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled. The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.  The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses. Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people. Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business. \"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it ‚Äì we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers. \"Unfortunately, it seems we\\'re in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres. \"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we\\'re not engaging fast enough.\" Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them. But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them. Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.  On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital. \"I just want to go home,\" he said over the phone. \"I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.\" The move comes after rights groups warned the Uyghurs face torture and possibly death back in China. \"I don\\'t know how to put it into words,\" says one of the hostages released from Gaza last month. A haven for the super rich, or a city built on scams? The BBC was invited to find out.    Police want to hear from anyone who knew Lamduan Armitage when she lived in South Yorkshire. David Armitage is held on suspicion of killing his wife whose body was found in the Yorkshire Dales. Copyright 2025 BBC.

       " \"At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.  The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.  The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.  The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.  Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.  The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'King Mohammed VI has asked Moroccans to abstain from performing the Muslim rite of slaughtering sheep during Eid al-Adha this year due to a sharp drop in the country\\'s herd.   The shortages are blamed on seven years of drought. Eid al-Adha, which falls in June, commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim, or Abraham, to sacrifice his son on God\\'s command.  Muslims mark the event by slaughtering sheep or other animals and the meat is shared among family and donated to the poor.  But herds in Morocco have shrunk by 38% in a decade due to dry pastures, according to official data. Meat prices are rocketing, and 100,000 sheep are being imported from Australia. Performing the rite \"under these difficult circumstances will cause significant harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,\" King Mohammed VI said in a speech read by the minister of religious affairs on national television on Wednesday. His father, Hassan II, made the same appeal back in 1966 when Morocco also suffered a long drought. Explaining the challenge in a recent interview, Morocco\\'s agriculture minister, Ahmed Bouari, said \"the need to secure water for priority sectors, such as driving and industry\" meant that agriculture was  the worst-hit, \"with most irrigation areas subject to strict regulations and water rationing\". Import tax and VAT on cattle, sheep, camels and red meat were recently lifted to help stabilise prices across Morocco.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school. The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\" He said that he was satisfied that the parents\\' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy\\'s parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\". The boy\\'s father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana. He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\". The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. \"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote. He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I\\'m begging to go back to my old school.\" However the High Court heard that the boy\\'s parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent\\'s worst nightmare\", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son\\'s \"destruction\". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy\\'s father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children\\'s charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.  The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn\\'t the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\" They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager. \"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\" The boy\\'s barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\" The boy\\'s father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy\\'s solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. \"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents\\' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\". Following the judgment, he added: \"We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.\"  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets in Bukavu, a city recently captured by the rebels.

       " 'The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year. Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor\\'s widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was \"proud\" of her husband\\'s impact at the BBC, and also said her family were \"thankful to the BBC for remembering him\" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent. As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC\\'s global audiences. Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world. The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences. Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year\\'s winner. During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith. Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: \"We are proud to launch this year\\'s BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.  \"Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor\\'s powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.  \"Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year\\'s winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply.\" Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC\\'s first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service. He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News\\' European morning segment. He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award. Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme. In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa\\'s top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent. In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine\\'s list of the 100 most influential Africans. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. \"He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me.\" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. \"I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,\" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men\\'s block right next door called \"Safina\", she says.  \"We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped.\" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.  Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.  By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that \"at least 153 women had perished\", quoting \"reliable sources in the prison\". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women\\'s section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. \"At one point I didn\\'t know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.  \"When I sleep at night, everything I\\'ve seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.\"  Nadine says she was also raped by two men.  \"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.   \"I don\\'t think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children\\'s clothing.  Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women\\'s section. \"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says. \"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.  Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.  However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. \"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women\\'s prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"  Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.  \"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\" Some of the prisoners who broke into the women\\'s section were looking for a safer escape route, she says. They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.  Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body. \"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn\\'t count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC. She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.  \"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\" The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one. Florence says the women\\'s prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help. \"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says. By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling. The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison. In a tent in the grounds of Goma\\'s hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend. She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine. But her agony is more than physical. Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison. \"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don\\'t know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.  She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother\\'s side. How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter? She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence. The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out. Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison. \"No-one will follow [this case],\" Sifa says. \"No-one will be pursued. It\\'s already over.\" Additional reporting from the BBC\\'s Wietske Burema, G√∂ktay Koraltan and Yvonne Katinga. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Nigeria\\'s former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993. A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend. Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time. Here are four takeaways from the book: This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria\\'s history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections. In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election. The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.  The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated. Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote. However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.  \"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes. At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country‚Äôs judiciary as reasons for the annulment. Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later. Nigeria\\'s current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place. Abiola‚Äôs son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members. \"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,‚Äù he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast. Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections. General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida\\'s presidency. \"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls. \"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\" However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.  \"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\" Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness. \"I had to choose between saving a friend\\'s life and the nation\\'s future,\" he writes. Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria\\'s first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders. The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects. He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny. The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover. The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president. Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters. \"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only \\'Igbo\\' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today\\'s Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as \\'Hausa\\' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\" The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.  Many Nigerians see Babangida\\'s wife Maryam as the country\\'s most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried. \"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes. \"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds. \"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah\\'s hands, not in humanity\\'s. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says. He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.

       " 'The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan\\'s civil war, the BBC has learned. Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump\\'s executive order halting contributions from the US government\\'s development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut. It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected. The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023. The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods. \"People are knocking on the volunteers\\' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\" The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID. The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice. The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes. The closure of the majority of Sudan\\'s emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world\\'s largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations. The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country\\'s civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID. It is a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms. The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN. Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works. \"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria.\" For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out. There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege. Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\". Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy\\'s Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID. \"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it\\'s never going to be what it was.\" \"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation. They are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\". The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful. \"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances. In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN\\'s Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan. Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington\\'s policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries. \"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP\\'s assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month. The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further. \"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees\\' regional bureau director. He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It\\'s extremely difficult.\" They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who\\'ve come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh. Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority. \"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said. Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people. They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing. Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape. Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan\\'s agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods. They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight. With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders. Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.  The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\". It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.  The UNHCR\\'s call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive. The US has been the UNHCR\\'s main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.  \"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC. Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", he says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant. Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood. \"I feel liberated,\" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own. The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman\\'s fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as \"getting your tubes tied\". Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya\\'s health ministry. It is unclear how many of these women didn\\'t already have children.  Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing. \"Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,\" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC. \"But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure.\" Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult. \"Doctors don\\'t typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,\" said Dr Bosire. Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children. She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading. Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation. \"I interacted with women\\'s life stories that didn\\'t feature children at all,\" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence. \"It made me realise that a life like this was possible.\" She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off. It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (¬£190; $230) at a private hospital. Ms Sironka felt that women\\'s rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision. It made her fear that a woman\\'s right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could. \"Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,\" she argued. When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life. And as for dating and relationships? \"I\\'m still thinking about it,\" she said with a shrug. And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood. Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation. Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster. She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure. \"I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,\" she told the BBC. Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation. \"I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,\" she said. Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau\\'s decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms. After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution. When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance. She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God. \"He asked me, \\'What if I meet someone who wants kids?\\'\" she said. The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an \"imaginary person\" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said. Ms Gitau said the dismissal was \"heart breaking\". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted. Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient\\'s right to make decisions about their health. \"This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn\\'t normal for women to want a tubal ligation,\" she said. Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles. \"It remains inconclusive,\" he told the BBC. But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services. She was armed with a bullet-point list of reasons to support her decision and was relieved to find there there was no pushback: \"The doctor was very kind.\" Currently single, she is living happily with her decision, which she feels gives her control over her own life. The 34-year-old is also happy with the reaction to her video - and relieved that there has been no major backlash. She says most people online have been cheering her on, which has seen her confidence grow. \"Women can contribute to the world in so many other ways,\" she said. \"It does not have to be through raising a whole human being. I am grateful to live in a generation where choice is a thing.\"  Additional reporting by the BBC\\'s Susan Gachuchi. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Legend has it Bernard Shabangu\\'s grandfather, Bhobho, once speared down a lion that was terrorising his community in Mpumalanga, a province in eastern South Africa. The story goes that the lion was so fearsome that even the white people who had guns would run away when it roared. \"One day, my grandfather is said to have walked up the hill where the lion was roaring with his spear and shield,\" says Bernard. \"The lion charged at him, but my grandfather speared him to death and was made Headman for his bravery.\" As a Headman, or traditional leader, Bhobho owned cattle and land. Then one day in the mid-1950s, it was all taken away from him with no compensation under a law introduced in 1950 called the Group Areas Act. This stated that South Africa\\'s apartheid government could choose certain areas to be used by a single race. In the early 1990s, democratic South Africa\\'s new constitution allowed for land taken from black farmers to be returned to them. But it did so with great care and the setting-up of new cross-community partnerships were encouraged. In this spirit, when Bernard, now 48, and his community decided to reclaim their land, they agreed to work in partnership with the white farmers who had been working on it. \"We did not say we want the white folks to leave,\" says Bernard. \"They are here, they are working with us, they are supporting us‚Ä¶ we are saying that partnership is what\\'s going to take this country forward.\" Today, the Matsamo Communal Property Association and its partners employ over 2,000 people from the local community and is the country\\'s biggest exporter of lychee to the US. It also grows papayas, sugar cane and bananas for local supermarkets. Matsamo has been hailed as an example of what successful land reform can look like in South Africa. But for some in the country, progress on land reform has been too slow. In January, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law a bill that allows, in some circumstances, land to be seized by the state without compensation. Opponents argue it is a threat to the principle of private ownership. And among those opponents is Donald Trump. He has said the new bill was \"hateful rhetoric\" towards \"racially disfavored landowners.\" Mr Trump said he would pause all aid to South Africa, which could be worth around $320m (¬£253m) according to the US Agency for International Development. Some worry he might eventually exclude South Africa from a trade agreement, estimated by the office of the US trade representative to be worth  $14.7bn (¬£11.6bn) a year. The challenge facing Rampahosa is a knotty one: can he find a way to speed up land reform to appease his political friends and foes, without losing one of the country\\'s biggest trading partners? Three and a half hours\\' drive west of the Matsamo CPA, near the town of Ermelo, is the farm of Lion du Plessis. He is an Afrikaner farmer, a descendant of Huguenots who once fled France. He works and lives on the farm his grandfather acquired in the 1970s. He grows maize and soybeans, as well as rearing sheep and cattle. His farm is spread across a thousand lush and green hectares with a serene lake in the middle of it. \"I was born on this farm, I grew up here and I\\'ve been farming since 2012,\" he tells me in the middle of one of his fields. For Lion, the new expropriation act threatens property rights and is a risk for farmers. \"Expropriation is not a problem if there\\'s compensation, but the compensation must be just and fair and equitable.\" He argues that without private property rights, farms such as his won\\'t be able to borrow money. \"If you put a tool like this in the government\\'s hands, where they can just take land, or take any property for that matter, it is not economically viable to invest in South Africa. \"In agriculture we need private property in order to access capital, we need to borrow money from the banks or from agricultural corporations to cover our costs. And if we don\\'t have private property rights, we won\\'t be able to get money and to get capital.\" The impact the bill could have on foreign investment is also of concern to AfriForum, a group that seeks to protect the rights of Afrikaners. \"We know that international investors, if they hear the term \"no compensation\", and you give that power to many state organisations, what they call an expropriation authority, then it will deter investment,\" its CEO Kallie Kriel tells me. But for Bernard these laws are a careful attempt to address long-standing unfairness. He insists: \"Land reform in South Africa is not going to be a vulgar land grab. What the president is proposing is a constitutionally-managed process of land reform for the public good, to say black and white people in South Africa must share in the land that is there.\" Professor Ruth Hall from the Institute for Poverty, Land, and Agrarian Studies of the University of the Western Cape argues the issue of access to land in South Africa dates back to before the start of formal apartheid in 1948. \"If we think about the history of South Africa, this is what we can call a settler colony. It was a colony in which large numbers of European settlers, over many centuries, came and settled, displacing indigenous people,\" she says. By the end of the 19th Century, most of the land that is currently South Africa had been taken over by white people. The Natives\\' Land Act of 1913 defined less than one-tenth of South Africa as Black \"reserves\" and prohibited any purchase or lease of land by Blacks outside the reserves. She says the subsequent Group Areas Act only reinforced the division and further reduced economic opportunities for black people. Prof Hall calls it \"structural apartheid geography\" and explains that this is \"very much intact,\" today. She describes how even though there is a growing black middle class in South Africa, there are still fundamental problems for the majority of black South Africans \"who either do not have access to well located land in the cities or who live in rural areas without secure rights.\" Agriculture remains one of the main sources of economic revenue for the country, but the majority of commercial agricultural land is still in the hands of the white minority which makes up around 7% of the population. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the no-compensation clause breaches section 25 of the constitution, which establishes property rights for all South Africans. Kallie Kriel thinks the bill is rife for abuse. He says: \"Actually, any reason can be used by the expropriating authority, which can be a corrupt or radical municipality.\" But land lawyer Bulelwa Mabasa, who was on a panel that advised President Cyril Ramaphosa on land reform, thinks that there are \"sufficient safeguards\" and says it\\'s clear when expropriation can take place: \"There is a very heavy burden that is placed on the expropriation authority to have reports from different departments, justifying the need for the expropriation in the first place, and justifying the need for expropriation without compensation.\" In 1996, the South African government launched its land reform programme, promising to settle all claims for redistribution by 2005 and to redistribute 30% of white-owned commercial agricultural land to black South Africans by 2014. The fact neither target has been met helps explain the pressure for last month\\'s toughened-up legislation. Prof Hall explains: \"There\\'s a mandate on the state that it must actually redistribute land. It must deal with historical claims to land.\" AfriForum has conceded that no large-scale land seizures have taken place and that the majority of land still remains in the hands of the white minority. But balancing the obligation to redistribute with property rights was never going to be straightforward. And now the debate around land ownership has gone beyond the borders of South Africa due to the recent intervention of US president Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on 7 February, just two and a half weeks after being sworn into office. The order claimed the expropriation act would \"enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners\\' agricultural property without compensation\". The executive order claimed the act was part of a number of discriminatory policies and \"hateful rhetoric\" towards \"racially disfavored landowners\". The American President also accused Pretoria of taking aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and strengthening its ties with Iran. As a result of these actions, Trump said he would pause all aid to South Africa and offered to resettle all \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\". South Africa\\'s case against Israel is seen by some as evidence it supports Hamas, in addition to the close ties it maintains with Iran. \"South Africa is trying to maintain its alliance with North America and Europe, while at the same time building its relationship with its partners in the global South,\" says Prof Hall. \"In my view, South Africa\\'s attempt to play both sides in an increasingly polarised world is what is really at play here.\" Trump is not the only figure in his administration to have taken an interest in South Africa\\'s internal affairs. So too has Elon Musk, who\\'s been tasked with managing government efficiency in the US. Musk, who was born in Pretoria, has been trying to license his Starlink telecommunications business in South Africa. But under the country\\'s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy telecom firms are required to have 30% ownership by black people. Musk called BEE \"racist\". Currently, only 3% of the country\\'s top companies are controlled by black South Africans. Every year, the US president reviews which African countries should continue to be part of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It allows some African countries to export goods to the US duty free and is credited with creating thousands of jobs across the continent, including in South Africa. But now there are fears Donald Trump\\'s promise to cut all \"future funding to South Africa\" may see South Africa excluded. Doing so may, however, be a bit of a blunt tool - Prof Hall points out that coming out of AGOA would ironically disproportionately affect the white farmers Donald Trump says he wants to protect. \"I can assure you that most white farmers are far more worried about this punitive act on our trade deal with the US than they are about land expropriation,\" she said. So can the South African government, and President Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s ANC specifically, satisfy those who believe further land reform is a must without being frozen out economically by the US and losing foreign investors? One job is to work out what is really driving Donald Trump. Nomvula Mokonyane, Deputy Secretary General of the ANC, does not believe this is solely about the issue of land and thinks South Africa\\'s position over Israel may well be the driver. She says: \"Our view is that we need to let our government engage the American administration, so that then we understand whether are we dealing with the issue of the expropriation of land, or are we dealing with many other issues‚Ä¶ related to Palestine and so on and so forth.\" The signing of the expropriation bill comes in the context of the ANC finding itself in a coalition with other parties for the first time, and it may be trying to signal to black voters that it\\'s still willing to fight for their rights. After Mr Trump\\'s funding freeze, Mr Ramaphosa said South Africa will not be bullied in his state of the nation address earlier this month. It\\'s one of the few positions that all his coalition partners appear to agree with. Prof Hall does not detect much possibility of any kind of u-turn on the new law. She says: \"We have said very clearly the Expropriation Act is a law that was passed by a democratic parliament. He has signed it into law, which is his obligation as state president.\" South Africa is already feeling the effects of US\\' diplomatic pressure: both the US secretary of state and the treasury secretary have refused to join their counterparts at this month\\'s G20 meetings hosted by South Africa. And there are concerns Donald Trump could also be absent from the leaders\\' summit later this year. President Ramaphosa has promised to send envoys to the US and other countries to explain his country\\'s positions on the expropriation act, the war in the Middle East, as well as some of its other foreign policy decisions. Whether South Africa can soften the current hostility coming from Washington, without compromising on its national priorities is a huge test for this fledgling democracy.

       " 'The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region\\'s two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted.  Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese. For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians.  Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo\\'s vast mineral wealth.  It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name. That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province. This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians. At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo. The perception that Congolese Tutsis are \"foreign\" can have deadly consequences.  Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu\\'s Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities. He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle\\'s son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC\\'s request for comment on this allegation. Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he \"wished the world knew\" his community was experiencing what he called a \"silent genocide\". Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu. \"I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (¬£120) to save myself from being imprisoned,\" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23\\'s cause. Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa.  Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority. Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo. As DR Congo\\'s Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities \"alternately empowered and the undermined\" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn\\'t Say Its Name. In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960. But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were \"derived of their nationality and left stateless\", a UN report noted.  In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996. It also states that \"many\" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats. Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community. But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites \"hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence\", the experts said. There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 \"in an apparent case of ethnic hatred\". Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment.  Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns. He told the BBC he had seen \"pretty terrifying\" social media posts over the past few weeks - \"a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they\\'re Rwandan\". Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23\\'s current uprising, Mr Stearns says \"many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels\". The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President F√©lix Tshisekedi said he had \"had enough\" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo. However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: \"We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community\". Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he \"strongly\" believed his ethnic group was discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she \"looked like a Rwandan spy\". This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries.  \"The Banyamulenge have been here since Congo was Congo!\" he said, exasperated.

       " 'An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D\\'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it\\'s banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available.  The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo\\'s factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo\\'s directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa.  In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn\\'t flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city\\'s chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets.  \"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale\\'s poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It\\'s not just in Tamale that Aveo\\'s pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo\\'s pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D\\'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high.  Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria\\'s National Bureau of Statistics.  The Chairman of Nigeria\\'s Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it\\'s in every community in Nigeria\". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol.  The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol.  West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC\\'s undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".  People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo\\'s new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep.  \"It could be deep enough that people don\\'t breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It\\'s a fairly painful experience.\" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana\\'s national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond.   The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India\\'s efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa.  These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India\\'s fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry\\'s exports are worth at least $28bn (¬£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC\\'s undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face‚Ä¶ with one of the men at the root of Africa\\'s opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn\\'t seem to care‚Ä¶ describing it simply as business.\" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo\\'s Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized.  \"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they\\'ll burn your drugs\". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.

       " 'Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised. In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it. More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone. The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around. They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger. For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times. The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000. A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter\\'s grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15. Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter\\'s cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother\\'s grave was stolen. In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter\\'s cross. \"This is my child\\'s grave - my fourth child,\" she said pointing towards the concrete cross. The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal. \"The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on,\" Ms Chumbi tells the BBC. \"There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles.\" Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home. Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi\\'s brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community. \"This is too bad‚Ä¶ when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot,\" he tells the BBC. The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites. The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; ¬£0.22-¬£0.28) per kilogramme.  It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol. \"Metal dealers often buy without asking questions,\" says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market. Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants. The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law. Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities. \"In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison,\" Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC. He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase. Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods. \"If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police.\" Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers. Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro\\'s health officer, said the city\\'s authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that \"this requires resources and time.  \"It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow.\" He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components. Tanzania\\'s government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry. Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations. \"What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe,\" he told the BBC. Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out. Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places. \"Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track,\" he says. For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration. Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest. She is in the process of replacing her mother\\'s cross for a second time - and, as in her daughter\\'s case - is opting for concrete. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.  Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded. This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.   The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on \"a foreign army\"  that he said was operating in the east. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23. He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.  \"There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.  It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu\\'s main square. In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects. \"This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,\" he said.  The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.  The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year. Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor\\'s widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was \"proud\" of her husband\\'s impact at the BBC, and also said her family were \"thankful to the BBC for remembering him\" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent. As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC\\'s global audiences. Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world. The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences. Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year\\'s winner. During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith. Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: \"We are proud to launch this year\\'s BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.  \"Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor\\'s powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.  \"Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year\\'s winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply.\" Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC\\'s first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service. He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News\\' European morning segment. He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award. Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme. In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa\\'s top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent. In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine\\'s list of the 100 most influential Africans. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year\\'s internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the L√©on Th√©venin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I\\'m a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L√©on Th√©venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren\\'t in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it\\'s accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L√©on Th√©venin\\'s deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'The UK\\'s decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is \"punitive\", authorities in the East African country have said. In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda\\'s support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo\\'s government says. The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was \"critical\" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, \"excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable\". Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about ¬£32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year. Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending \"future defence training assistance\", the statement said. These measures will last until \"significant progress\" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda\\'s foreign ministry said the \"punitive measures\" announced by the UK government \"in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable\". \"The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC.\" The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda. The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK\\'s government. DR Congo\\'s government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda. Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda\\'s Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe.  The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda\\'s support for M23. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23\\'s spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said. Responding to the US move, Rwanda\\'s foreign ministry said the sanctions were \"unjustified\". The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state. The rebels have captured eastern DR Congo\\'s two biggest cities, Goma and Bukavu.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " \"At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.  The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.  The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.  The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.  Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.  The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. \"He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me.\" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. \"I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,\" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men\\'s block right next door called \"Safina\", she says.  \"We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped.\" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.  Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.  By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that \"at least 153 women had perished\", quoting \"reliable sources in the prison\". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women\\'s section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. \"At one point I didn\\'t know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.  \"When I sleep at night, everything I\\'ve seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.\"  Nadine says she was also raped by two men.  \"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.   \"I don\\'t think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children\\'s clothing.  Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women\\'s section. \"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says. \"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.  Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.  However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. \"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women\\'s prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"  Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.  \"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\" Some of the prisoners who broke into the women\\'s section were looking for a safer escape route, she says. They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.  Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body. \"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn\\'t count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC. She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.  \"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\" The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one. Florence says the women\\'s prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help. \"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says. By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling. The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison. In a tent in the grounds of Goma\\'s hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend. She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine. But her agony is more than physical. Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison. \"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don\\'t know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.  She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother\\'s side. How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter? She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence. The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out. Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison. \"No-one will follow [this case],\" Sifa says. \"No-one will be pursued. It\\'s already over.\" Additional reporting from the BBC\\'s Wietske Burema, G√∂ktay Koraltan and Yvonne Katinga. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu\\'s 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government. In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president\\'s decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country\\'s farmers. In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu\\'s election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister. The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu\\'s most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament. \"You don\\'t address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture,\" said El-Rufai. \"Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries,\" he said. \"I have issues with many of them [Tinubu\\'s policies], and I\\'m in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately.\" The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made. El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party. \"As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party\\'s candidate,‚Äù he noted. He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report. \"The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on,\" El-Rufai said. The politician, who has been seen with opposition figures recently, did not rule out moving to another party before the next general elections in 2027.

       " 'A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk. The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor\\'s donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( ¬£1.7m) to the group to help it \"further its messages of racial hatred and separation\".  But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and \"contrary to public policy\". Trump has referred to the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were \"racist ownership laws\" and previously condemned the \"genocide of white people\". Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced. Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US. The court action was brought by Mr Gray\\'s four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust. In it, they claimed that their brother had become \"obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa\" in the last 10 years of his life.  He died in March 2022. Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed \"genocide\" would occur soon. \"That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to,\" Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light. Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (¬£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group. The Boerelegioen describes itself as a \"civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property\". Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran.  But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray\\'s bequest made was \"vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary\" of his will. \"The only expression of the [Mr Gray\\'s] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for \\'training\\' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real,\" Judge Allie said. On the public policy issue, Mr Gray\\'s siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to \"further... its messages of racial hatred and separation\".  Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion.  Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs  in the court case. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances. The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics. But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country\\'s white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.  Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.  In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Police in Uganda are investigating the death of a Nigerian professional footballer who allegedly fell from a shopping mall in the capital, Kampala. Abubakar Lawal, 29, reportedly fell from a third-floor balcony at the Voicemall Shopping Arcade, where he had gone to visit a Tanzanian friend. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead, the police said. They said Lawal\\'s friend, identified as Omary Naima, had left him in her room - which is part of the mall building - preparing tea before the incident happened. Lawal was a striker playing for local team Vipers Sports Club, which has expressed its sadness for the \"untimely passing of our beloved player\". Tributes have been flowing in for the Nigerian forward, fondly known as \"Man from Sokoto\". He has been with Vipers since July 2022 after a two-year stint with AS Kigali in Rwanda. In 2023, he helped Vipers win the league and cup double. In a post on X, the club said: \"Lawal (Man from Sokoto) was a unique person\". \"He had a big heart of gold. He really cared about people and went out of his way to help. He was incredibly generous.\" His former team in Nigeria, Nasarawa United, said: \"We mourn the sudden demise of our ex-player Abubakar Lawal earlier today. May God grant him eternal rest.\" Ugandan footballer Mustafa Kizza said he would be forever missed: \"It\\'s hard to take in that you\\'re no more Lawal  A kind, talented, jolly, and loving person you have been.\" Local media say the matter has left more questions than answers amid conflicting reports over the circumstances of Lawal\\'s death. Some media initially reported that he had died in a motorcycle accident. As a result of such \"contrary information\", Nigeria\\'s authorities should probe the incident, Nigerian international Ahmed Musa said on social media. He added: \"Lawal\\'s soul deserves a thorough investigation and justice must be served if anyone is found guilty.\" Police in Uganda said they were already investigating the exact circumstances of the death. \"Authorities are retrieving CCTV footage and conducting thorough interrogations to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident,\" police said. The police have retrieved some items belonging to the deceased player, including two smartphones, shoes, headsets and a training kit. \"Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses,\" the police added.

         "US needs role in Ukraine to deter Putin, says PM",
         "Sir Keir Starmer has reiterated his call for a US security guarantee in Ukraine to deter Vladimir Putin from invading again, as he prepares to meet Donald Trump.",
         "Sir Keir Starmer has reiterated his call for a US security guarantee in Ukraine to deter Vladimir Putin from invading again, as he prepares to meet Donald Trump. Speaking on the plane to Washington DC, Sir Keir said he hoped the UK-US relationship could go from \"strength to strength\". But the two leaders appear to be at odds over the importance of US security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any peace deal there. Sir Keir said discussions about potentially sending British troops to Ukraine were ongoing but he re-emphasised his belief in the importance of a so-called US \"backstop\". Asked what form he believed this backstop should take, he said: \"Exactly what the configuration of that is, exactly what the backstop is, is obviously the subject of intense discussion but I'm not going to get ahead of myself on it, other than to say I'm very clear about what the principles are.\" In contrast, Trump has said: \"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond very much.  \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about Europe as the next door neighbour.\" The president did add that the expected deal between Washington and Kyiv over access to Ukrainian minerals was \"great\" for Ukraine \"because they get us over there.\" \"We will be on the land and that way there is going to be automatic security because nobody is going to be messing around with our people.\" It is not yet known how much security support European leaders are asking for from America, nor is the scale of any American manpower on the ground in Ukraine associated with a minerals deal. The prime minister said: \"I'm considering how we preserve peace in Europe and how we get a lasting peace in Ukraine.  \"And I'm absolutely convinced that we need a lasting peace, not a ceasefire, and for that to happen we need security guarantees.  \"Precisely what that layers up to, what that looks like, is obviously a subject of intense discussion. We will play our part and I've been clear that we will need a US backstop of some sort. \"My concern is if there is a ceasefire without a backstop, it will simply give him [Putin] the opportunity to wait and to come again because his ambition in relation to Ukraine is pretty obvious, I think, for all to see.\" Speaking at a reception at the UK Ambassador's residence in Washington on Wednesday evening, the Sir Keir told guests that he wanted to strike a \"new partnership\" with the United States, and said \"our best days lie ahead\". On domestic policy, the prime minister said that \"taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style\" - a reference to an Elon Musk stunt at the conservative CPAC conference earlier this week - but said \"we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy\". Lord Mandelson, the British ambassador, said Trump was a \"very consequential president\" and that \"all the freedom-loving democracies in the world\" faced a \"very significant moment\". \"The US and the United Kingdom, we basically share everything together,\" he said. \"And of course one thing we don't need to fight over is trade, because we have this fantastically fair and balanced trade relationship when we reciprocate so much - that's just a little thing for you to remember in the coming weeks.\" Tariffs on steel imports to the US are set to come into force in March, with the president also considering other import taxes as part of his drive to protect American businesses. After the visit from Sir Keir, Trump will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Zelensky has said the deal on minerals is preliminary and that he still wants further agreements, arguing that without security guarantees from the US \"we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work.\" Foreign Secretary David Lammy, speaking to ITV's Peston programme, sounded hopeful about a deal. \"If US interests are on the ground in Ukraine, then that is the best security guarantee that the Ukrainians can have,\" he said.  Sir Keir was notably guarded in his remarks in advance of Thursday's meetings in the White House, such are the stakes and sensitivities around Ukraine, the Middle East and trade with America since Trump's inauguration. Strengthening and deepening the US-UK relationship might be his ambition, but it is far from guaranteed with such an unpredictable president. But asked if he could trust Trump, given what he had said in recent weeks, the prime minister replied: \"Yes, I've got a good relationship with him.  \"As you know, I've met him, I've spoken to him on the phone, and this relationship between our two countries is a special relationship with a long history, forged as we fought wars together, as we traded together.\" Does he think President Trump sees Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine? \"Of course, the president has been very clear about the peace that he wants - he's right about that.  \"We all want peace - the question is, how do we make sure it's a lasting peace.\" \"There's no issue between us on this,\" Sir Keir insisted. Theresa May, former prime minister and Conservative peer, urged Sir Keir to tell Trump that Russia is the aggressor in Ukraine. Speaking in the House of Lords on Wednesday, she said: \"Will he impress on President Trump that...the defence of Europe benefits the defence of America, and the Ukrainians are fighting for their independence and their sovereignty - principles which should be defended by all of us who value or benefit from economic and democratic freedom.\" Earlier this week, the prime minister announced the UK would boost military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, a move seen as an attempt to curry favour with the US president who has frequently attacked European countries for failing to spend more on defence.  The increase is being funded by a cut to the foreign aid budget which has angered international development charities and some of the prime minister's own MPs.  The UK's former security adviser Lord Sedwill told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was taking the right tack in increasing defence spending and urging its European neighours to do the same. He said: \"By showing we're willing to do more on defence... to build that capability, I think we're showing that Europe will step up and that's the best way to keep the US invested, even under a Trump presidency.\"  In addition to the Ukraine war, talks are also expected to take in a discussion about trade and artificial intelligence. Downing Street wants what it calls \"further integration\" between the two countries' technology sectors. The potential flashpoints for Sir Keir are numerous and considerable - it is a landmark moment in his first year as prime minister.

President Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US has given over $300bn to Ukraine, but he is incorrect. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. The decision goes against a lower court judge's ruling that the government had to pay aid contractors. The first minister is calling on civic Scotland to come together and tackle populist politics.

         "MP Mike Amesbury's jail term suspended on appeal",
         "MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal.",
         "MP Mike Amesbury, who admitted repeatedly punching a constituent in the street, has had his 10-week prison sentence suspended following an appeal. The Runcorn and Helsby MP assaulted Paul Fellows, 45, following a row in Frodsham, Cheshire, last year and was jailed by magistrates on Monday. Amesbury, who had the Labour whip removed in October, launched an appeal and a judge said that while the length of the sentence had been \"spot on\", it should be suspended for two years. Judge Steven Everett, sitting with two magistrates at Chester Crown Court, also ordered Amesbury to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Amesbury must also undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course, and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work. His sentence still leaves the 55-year-old MP, who now sits as an independent, at risk of being ousted. If at least 10% of his constituents back a recall petition, a by-election will take place. Leaving court, Amesbury refused to answer questions from the waiting media about whether he would resign as an MP. But he said: \"I'd like to reiterate that I sincerely apologise once again to Mr Fellows and his family. \"I'm now going to go and see my family, and go home, and I'll give a statement at a later stage.\" Video footage of the assault, which happened near a taxi rank in the early hours of 26 October, which was played in court. It showed Amesbury punching Mr Fellows in the head, knocking him to the ground. The politician then hit him at least five more times and swore at him. Amesbury was then heard saying: \"You won't threaten your MP again, will you?\" Judge Everett told Amesbury the facts showed him \"in a truly unfavourable light\" and, as an MP, he \"should be showing an example\".  While acknowledging it would be wrong to sentence him differently because he was an MP, the judge added: \"That doesn't mean we can't take into account that your behaviour as an MP was simply disgraceful.\" He said he also could not ignore Amesbury's \"heavy drinking and fighting\". The former Labour politician had arrived at court in a prison van and wore handcuffs as he was led into the building. The court heard that, in a prepared statement given in a police interview, Amesbury claimed he had been approached by a man \"shouting and screaming\" about local and national matters. The MP said that, because he was terrified and the other man's \"arms were swinging\", he felt he had no option but to \"defend\" himself. But the judge told him the CCTV pictures revealed a very different story. \"In reality, you told the police a pack of lies. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he said. Judge Everett questioned why a charge of affray - which can carry a longer sentence - had not been brought by the prosecution. Daniel Travers, defending Amesbury, told the court: \"He's now had three nights in prison which is an experience he will never forget, certainly.\" He said the \"public shaming\" and \"embarrassment\" had had a huge impact on his client.  \"This is a man who will certainly rehabilitate,\" said Mr Travers. \"He will learn a very painful lesson.\" The confirmation of Amesbury's prison sentence, even though it has now been suspended, could still result in him being ousted from the Commons. The long-time Labour politician has been sitting as an independent MP for the last four months, following his suspension by party bosses. Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence a \"recall petition\" is triggered. After hearing from Chester Crown Court, the Speaker of the House of Commons will contact the returning officer for Amesbury's Runcorn and Helsby constituency. Constituents will then have six weeks to ask for their MP's removal by registering at 10 nominated places. If at least 10% of them vote to remove Amesbury, a by-election will be called. It would be the first by-election since Labour came to power following the July 2024 general election. Having first been elected as a Labour MP in the Cheshire constituency of Weaver Vale in 2017, Amesbury comfortably won the Runcorn and Helsby seat which was created following boundary changes. He secured 53% of the vote and  enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000. Reform UK beat the Conservatives (16%) into second place. The former Labour politician has had a 10-week prison sentence suspended following his assault conviction.

         "A 19-year-old woman has died after she was attacked by a dog believed to be an XL bully, police have said. Two people have been arrested following the attack at about 19:00 GMT on Wednesday at a property on Cobhorn Drive, south Bristol. Officers confirmed the dog has now been put down. Initial reports suggested it may be an XL bully, but police said it was too early to confirm the breed. A man and woman, both in their 20s, are in custody after being arrested on suspicion of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death and possession of a prohibited breed of dog. The woman's family have been informed and are being supported by a specially trained officer, police said. A neighbour who lives close to the scene said the woman had only lived in the property a few weeks. \"She seemed a lovely girl,\" said the neighbour, who did not wish to give her name. \"I am still trying to process this. I was up all night awake trying to process this. \"I am shocked. I just can't believe it's happened and she hasn't been there that long.\" Referring to the dog owner, the neighbour said: \"The moment she walked out the door I could hear her, and I ran over to her and said, 'Are you okay?' \"She couldn't talk or say a word. It was like she wasn't there because of the shock.\" Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Insp Terry Murphy, from Avon and Somerset Police, called the incident \"incredibly rare\". \"The circumstances [officers] faced were \"immensely difficult\", he said. \"Our thoughts, first and foremost, are with the family of the young woman who's tragically died as a result of yesterday evening's incident. \"A full investigation is now well under way to establish the full circumstances of the events that led to her death.\" Police do not consider there to be any ongoing risk to the public, he added, but there will be increased police presence in the area over the coming days. He declined to comment on whether the woman who died lived at the address where the incident happened, or if there had been previous police contact with the household. Doreen Tovey said the incident was \"very frightening\". \"I came out my house to see what all the commotion was,\" she said. \"[There were] loads of police cars, riot van, ambulance across the road from me.\" Resident Gary Steadman said he heard \"screaming\" and that the incident was heart-breaking.  He also described the dog as \"big, butch and brown and white\" in colour. The road has reopened following a closure for investigative work on Wednesday night.  Police have urged witnesses or anybody with information about the incident to contact them by calling 101. Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

         "Quizzer Chris Hughes, star of the popular BBC and Channel 5 series Eggheads, has died aged 77, a statement on the programme's social media accounts has said.",
         "Quizzer Chris Hughes, star of the popular BBC and Channel 5 series Eggheads, has died aged 77, a statement on the programme's social media accounts has said. Hughes was one of several general knowledge experts who regularly appeared on the show, which saw members of the public take on the five so-called \"Eggheads\". A statement posted on the show's Facebook and X accounts on Thursday, reported by the Press Association news agency, paid tribute to an \"Eggheads great\". \"It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of Eggheads great Chris Hughes,\" it read. \"Chris joined the show in 2003 and over the next 20 years gave us not only brilliant answers but very many laughs and happy memories.\" It concluded: \"He will be hugely missed by all his Eggheads family.\" Hughes was born in Middlesex and attended Enfield Grammar School. Before becoming known as one of the country's leading quizzers, he worked as a train driver and railway worker.  He went on to become a regular contributor on Eggheads - which began on BBC Two in 2003 before moving to Channel 5 in 2020.  The Eggheads panel was made up of general knowledge experts, including winners from others shows such as Mastermind, The Weakest Link and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. In each episode, five Eggheads would compete with a team made up of five members of the public, who would play individually against a single Egghead in each round, before a final face-off between the remaining players of both sides.  If the amateurs were successful, they would take home a cash prize. The jackpot would increase by ¬£1,000 per episode, with each edition's prize money rolling into the next day if the Eggheads won. As a result of the Eggheads high level of expertise, many of the jackpots would reach a sizeable sum before finally being won. The highest ever jackpot reached ¬£75,000, which was won by a team in 2007. The series was presented by news presenter Dermot Murnaghan, before Radio 2 DJ and Channel 5 talk show host Jeremy Vine took over the role. Hughes is one of only seven people to have won both Brain of Britain and Mastermind, and also scored a victory on International Mastermind. Eggheads producer Robert Dean said on X: \"[Hughes] was an amazing Egghead who considered everyone on the production team part of his family.  \"I have such fond memories of him and count myself lucky to have known him. I'll miss him tremendously.\" After having reached the final of another hit quiz show, The Weakest Link, without getting a single question wrong, host Anne Robinson declared Hughes to be \"the best contestant we have had on the Weakest Link\" and chose not to use her mean spirited signature catchphrase: \"you are the Weakest Link, goodbye!\".

         "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
         "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed. The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade. The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission. If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The ¬£2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment. \"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday. Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process. The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month. Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year. On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\". The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.  An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights. Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\". Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.  It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings. But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners. Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. \"The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,\" he added. Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country. \"People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,\" he added. Union Unite backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need \"to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers\". Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be \"a win for everyone\". She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.  \"That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.\" Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about \"uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change\". \"We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,\" she said.  The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added. Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise. On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels. Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released. But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF. The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying. At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.

         "Groomed girl was 'fixated on Hitler' before death",
         "A schoolgirl who was groomed online by a far-right extremist in the US became \"fixated\" on Adolf Hitler and wanted to \"blow up a synagogue\" before she took her own life, an inquest has heard.",
         "A schoolgirl who was groomed online by a far-right extremist in the US became \"fixated\" on Adolf Hitler and wanted to \"blow up a synagogue\" before she took her own life, an inquest has heard. Rhianan Rudd, 16, downloaded bomb manuals, guides on guerrilla warfare and media glorifying white supremacy and Nazism, Chesterfield Coroner's Court was told. Her mother referred her to the deradicalisation programme Prevent - but she was later arrested by counter-terrorism officers and then placed under investigation by MI5. The court heard several months after the charges were dropped, Rhianan was found dead at a children's home in Nottinghamshire on 19 May 2022. Aged 15, she was the youngest girl charged with terror offences in the UK, before the prosecution was discontinued. Before the inquest evidence began, a statement paying tribute to Rhianan was read out on behalf of her mother, Emily Carter. In it, she said her daughter had a love of horses and cats and had a passion for cooking, which was \"one of the times she was the happiest\" and that art became an outlet \"when she couldn't say something\". But Ms Carter said Rhianan - who was autistic - became \"fixated\" on things due to her condition, and said: \"Her being groomed was huge and I saw her change and it had a huge impact on her.\" An email was read out from Rhianan's mother to Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands (CTPEM) requesting help from the Prevent programme. It said: \"I need help with my 15-year-old daughter. She has a very unhealthy outlook on fascism ‚Äì she also has massive dislikes for certain races and creeds. \"I have done my best to deter her from any such ideologies, but it seems to be falling on deaf ears. I would like some help on the matter.\" The subsequent referral form said this started off as an interest in world wars, but then turned towards a \"fixation on Hitler\" and admiration for him. \"She classes herself as a fascist and has quite a lot of hate towards other races,\" the form stated. Ms Carter said they were waiting for hospital treatment for Rhianan's mental health. The court also heard Rhianan had a \"history of self-harm\". A report by CTPEM, in September 2020, outlined that a joint assessment had taken place and said \"it does not meet the criteria for [a criminal investigation]\", but if \"things escalated\" then it would be referred back to them. Edward Pleeth, counsel for the inquest, read out another report from CTPEM later that month, which detailed that Rhianan had told her mother she \"wants to go to a synagogue and blow it up\", and has spoken about \"slitting people's throats\". The report said: \"[We need] to ascertain her online presence i.e. who is she speaking to? Is she being coerced by anybody in her way of thinking?\" Disclosure from MI5 was read to the court, which showed Rhianan was speaking to Chris Cook, a 23-year-old neo-Nazi from the US who sent her \"racially-motivated links\" to read.  The inquest was told the then-partner of Rhianan's mother, American Dax Mallaburn, also had an influence which was \"not known\" to Ms Carter. The inquest heard a student at Rhianan's school provided a statement to senior staff, in which she repeated a desire to \"blow up a synagogue\". In October 2020, Supt Stephen Riley, head of CTPEM, told the court two police officers attended Rhianan's home in Bolsover, Derbyshire, seizing a USB memory stick and a diary from her. Analysis found PDF manuals on how to make a bomb and material of a far-right nature. CPTEM then passed the information on to MI5, which opened an investigation. The court was told on 20 October 2020, during a meeting, that police and MI5 had decided Rhianan would not be arrested because it was \"believed to risk some impact on her mental health\" and \"could possibly lead to further self-harm and suicide attempts\". But after Rhianan was admitted to hospital in Chesterfield that same day after \"carving a swastika\" on to her forehead, the court was told a decision was made the following day to arrest her due to \"new information and a risk to others\". Despite Rhianan being assessed by Prevent after her mother made a referral in September 2020, her case was closed after a criminal investigation began the following month. At that stage her case was deemed to be beyond the remit of the deradicalisation scheme. The inquest heard after Rhianan was arrested on 22 October 2020, MI5 discussed with the police officer running the investigation whether an \"exception\" on Prevent could be made for Rhianan, but the detective had said it could not. Supt Riley said the detective was \"following the guidance that was available in 2020\". Charges against Rhianan were dropped in late December in 2021, after a Home Office unit that deals with modern slavery and trafficking made a formal finding that she was a victim of exploitation. But the court heard the referral to the Home Office was not made by police after they began investigating Rhianan in autumn 2020.  Rather, the inquest heard it was only made at the instigation of defence lawyers after she was charged in April 2021. Supt Riley was questioned about whether there had been a missed opportunity for police to make a referral in November 2020, but he said that was not the case. The inquest heard in 2020, counter-terrorism officers did not receive training about modern slavery referrals, even though the relevant legislation had been in force since 2015.

         "A murder investigation has been launched after a man was found dead at the scene of a reported aggravated burglary. Nottinghamshire Police said the man was found by detectives who were called to an industrial unit in Lodge Lane, Tuxford, at about 22:40 GMT on Tuesday. He has been formally identified as 22-year-old Taylor Green, the force added. A 24-year-old man and 21-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of murder as part of the investigation. On Thursday afternoon, police said the man remained in custody, while the woman had been released without charge. Officers carried out CPR on the victim but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Det Insp Clare Gibson, who is leading the inquiry, said there would be an increased police presence in the area following the man's death. \"Our thoughts remain with Mr Green's loved ones during what must be an incredibly difficult time for them,\" she said. \"We are actively seeking another three males in connection with the aggravated burglary and we have multiple teams and force resources dedicated to this search. \"I'd like to reassure the public that we believe this to be an isolated incident and there will be an increased police presence in the area while we continue with our lines of inquiry.\" The force said the victim's family had been informed and were being supported by specially trained officers.

         "A \"gifted\" NHS nurse who was deliberately left out of a tea round by a colleague who said \"I don't like you\" has won a claim for unfair constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal.",
         "A \"gifted\" NHS nurse who was deliberately left out of a tea round by a colleague who said \"I don't like you\" has won a claim for unfair constructive dismissal at an employment tribunal. Diabetes specialist Susan Hamilton joined Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in 2012 but resigned in January 2022 \"as a direct consequence of the actions of, and poor management by, the trust\". She cited \"cruel bullying behaviours\" by a colleague after a 2018 disagreement when she questioned his competency over a patient's treatment.  Her claim stated that Abdool Nayeck's behaviour also included \"ignoring morning greetings from her and facing the other way when [she] was presenting in meetings\". On Tuesday, the judgement by the London (South) Employment Tribunal awarding Ms Hamilton ¬£41,000, was published.. After the 2018 incident over a patient who had collapsed at home, Ms Hamilton apologised to Mr Nayeck for her tone.  Ms Hamilton stated he later took her book, rubbed out her name and wrote his instead before storing it in a cupboard containing his own documents and books. The NHS trust has not publicly commented but is understood to have subsequently strengthened support for staff and rolled out a new training programme for managers. In a 2019 mediation session, Mr Nayeck agreed to \"follow advice regarding the tone of emails and not send every message as high priority\" and both agreed \"to communicate in a civil manner with each other at work\". Ms Hamilton's submission stated: \"I tried very hard to build a better relationship with Abdool particularly following mediation.  \"I have offered him tea or coffee, have tried to talk to him about, for example, how he enjoyed his Eid celebrations‚Ä¶ I have not had any reciprocal treatment from Abdool. \"The only change that occurred from [Mr Nayeck's] side is that he no longer made drinks for the team in the morning so by extension I was no longer specifically excluded in that regard.\" In 2021, a letter was sent to Ms Hamilton stating \"there was no evidence to show that you had shown bullying behaviour\" towards Mr Nayeck, who had lodged a complaint. Ms Hamilton was again signed off by her GP in August 2021 with \"work-related stress\" and was undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy when she resigned in January 2022. \"I could not handle another year of going through this,\" Ms Hamilton told the tribunal.  \"I was really suffering.\" In her judgment, employment judge Kathryn Ramsden said Ms Hamilton's testimony was \"powerful\". She wrote: \"She was a gifted nurse, who loved her job and she was immensely distressed to have found herself in a situation where she could not do it. \"On the trust's own evidence Mr Nayeck's conduct and communications towards the claimant continued to fall far short of the standards it expected, and yet it appeared to do very little beyond speaking to Mr Nayeck ‚Äì which evidently made no difference - except for make suggestions that it did not then follow through.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

         "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
         "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school. The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\" He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\". The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana. He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\". The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. \"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote. He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\" However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.  The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\" They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager. \"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\" The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\" The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. \"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\". Following the judgment, he added: \"We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.\"  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets in Bukavu, a city recently captured by the rebels.

         "UK asylum claims hit highest level since 1979",
         "The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show.",
         "The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show. According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021. The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002. The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022. The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the \"EU plus\" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog.  These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024. The number remains higher than before 2022. The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%.  Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023. There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024. The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were \"no quick fixes\" to the \"global\" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a \"serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system\". Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a \"broken asylum system\", saying Labour inherited a \"huge backlog\" of claims. \"We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again.\" Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said \"many people want to come here\", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum. She underlined \"we have to be much tougher\" dealing with visa overstayers. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as \"no surprise,\" saying there was \"no deterrent\". Philp added that the blame for the numbers \"lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border\". The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create \"more safe routes\" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK. \"Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option,\" Bhutta said in a statement. \"For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here.\" New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that  anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship. The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs.  The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was \"encouraged\" the government continued to work on the \"broken asylum system\" during its first six months in power. However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people \"stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work\". The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023. The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament. The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation. While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped. The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes ‚Äì including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa. The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK. The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000. This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000). Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route. The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas. But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year. In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers. A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration. Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford,  referred to a \"boom and bust\" in some visa categories over recent years. \"The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,\" he said.  \"Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "People who have already had norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, could be at risk of catching it again this season, experts from the the UK's Health Security Agency say. ",
         "People who have already had norovirus, the winter vomiting bug, could be at risk of catching it again this season, experts from the the UK's Health Security Agency say.  Data shows a different strain of the virus is on the rise and having had one strain doesn't necessarily protect you from catching another, they advise. Norovirus can be particularly severe for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems.  Cases are currently still \"exceptionally high\" with numbers at more than double the five-season-average for this time of year, latest figure show. Amy Douglas, Lead Epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said the biggest impact was being seen in hospitals and care homes.  \"With multiple genotypes spreading at the same time, people could end up getting infected more than once this season,\" she added. Cases have been higher than expected partly because of the emergence of a recent strain of the virus called GII.17, but also because of improved ways of testing for the virus.  Data now shows that a different, but more commonly seen strain, is on the rise.  This means people who have already had the bug could catch it again as having one version of the virus does not fully protect you against the other.  There is no suggestion that either strain leads to more severe illness than expected, however. Norovirus cases usually starts to decline as the weather warms up, but the UKHSA says it is too soon to work out whether cases have peaked.  The total remains close to its record high, with an average of 1,134 patients a day in hospital with norovirus last week ‚Äì down slightly on the previous week (1,160), but still nearly two and a half times that seen in the same period last year. Symptoms of norovirus include: If you think you may have norovirus, experts advise: Many household disinfectants do not work well against the virus. Nor do alcohol hand gels. If you are concerned - for example if a young child is not able to keep fluids down or the illness does not stop after a few days - make sure you seek medical advice Do not visit hospitals and care homes or prepare food for others, until 48 hours after symptoms have stopped. Nurses working with call handlers at East Midlands Ambulance Service are helping to ease pressure. The application says it would make it one of the most sustainable healthcare sites in the country. Former Arsenal and Everton striker Kevin Campbell died aged 54 after treatment for a heart infection.  Seven hospices will be able to use the money for projects like buying equipment, renovations and IT. A Wiltshire care provider says the financial situation of the care sector is \"really worrying\".

         "The island split over where to build a new high school",
         "For decades, children on Mull have been divided by the location of the island's only high school.",
         "For decades, children on Mull have been divided by the location of the island's only high school. Pupils living in the north of Scotland's fourth largest island go to school in Tobermory, its main settlement. But most of those living over an hour-and-a-half's drive away in the south face having to leave their families and catch a ferry to Oban on the Scottish mainland, where they stay in boarding school hostels during the week. With Tobermory High School falling into a state of disrepair and plans being made to build a multi-million pound replacement, many of those in the south see it as a chance to put right what they regard as being a historical injustice. They are campaigning for the new school to be based in a more central location such as Craignure, which is home to the main ferry port and the island's hospital. This would allow pupils from both ends of the island to attend the same school - so children in the south would be able to stay at home once they reach secondary school age. But some parents in the north of the island want the new school to be built close to the site of the existing high school in Tobermory. Argyll and Bute Council has shortlisted four options for the location of the new school, and had been due to make a decision on Thursday - but the vote has been delayed until a special meeting of the council on 7 March.   The new development will be a replacement for the current high school, meaning wherever it is built it will be a campus made up of a nursery, primary and secondary school. Choosing any location apart from Tobermory would leave the town with no school. Many community members had hoped that a \"split option\" would be made available allowing a central high school to be built as well a new primary school and nursery for the community of Tobermory, but the council says that is too expensive. Marion MacLean lives in Tobermory and her two daughters currently attend the high school. While the decision won't directly impact on her family, Marion feels this is the \"one chance to get it right for every child that lives on the island\". While she feels it is important not be \"remiss of the feelings\" of families in the Ross of Mull, she has concerns about the impact on the village she has called home all her life. She told BBC Scotland News: \"Tobermory can't lose its primary school.  \"It would have a huge impact on the businesses on the high street, and I think we would lose that community feel of having the children around the town during the day.\" Four miles off the main road through the Ross of Mull is the village of Carsaig, which is home to Amy Simpson and her daughters Daisy, six, and Rosie, four. Amy said that if the council's preferred option of a new school in Tobermory is selected she would feel forced to leave her village when her kids reach secondary school age, rather than be separated from them if they had to board in Oban. She added: \"We love our life here, we have become an integral part of our community. \"We don't want to leave and we don't want to take our kids out of this community, this is where they were born and where they are growing up.\" Fifty miles south of Tobermory, a journey which takes around an hour-and-a-half in a car due to the single track roads, is the village of Bunessan. Rob Claxton-Ingham, who lives on a croft with his husband, said the future was uncertain as he doesn't know where his foster child will attend secondary school. As things stand, she faces travelling and boarding in Oban every week - like all children on the south of the island. He told BBC Scotland News: \"As a foster carer, our child has faced separation and loss already from her birth family and has had to transition to us as her substitute carers. \"The thought of her transitioning again at the age of 11 to a school, over the sea, where she has to get a ferry, where she won't get our day-to-day support, is hard.\" Rob said high school has always been \"an issue\" for the community, and people have \"learned to be as ok as they can be with it\". \"But this situation is developing something new and it really hurts that Argyll and Bute Council could develop something new and, actually while doing that plan, to continue excluding people at this end of the island,\" he added. Rebekah MacLean and her four kids also live in the village of Bunessan. Her youngest children attend the local primary school, but for her secondary-aged children things are a little bit more complicated. She said: \"For me, what I am seeking is equality across the island for all children whether that's primary age, early education or secondary students. \"One key aspect of that is the secondary school being centrally based, so all the children can attend and no child has to be put in the position of choosing between education and family.\" Rebekah has managed to make arrangements for her son, Jude, 15, to stay with a family friend in Tobermory during the week so he is slightly closer to home, while her daughter, Acacia, 14, is home-schooled. Jude is also in favour of a centrally-located school so that when it comes to his siblings' time to go to high school, they can stay at home and have a less uninterrupted education than him. He said: \"I do worry that because I have to travel so far, I have less time in school. \"I want to be an engineer, that requires straight As.  \"I worry I won't be able to get those because I have to travel so much and I'm maybe behind in class.\" It is clear that the debate on where the new school should be built is an issue that is consuming islanders. Everywhere you go, everyone has an opinion on it. Argyll and Bute Council said: \"Building a new 2-18 campus on Mull is Argyll and Bute Council's single biggest investment, estimated at ¬£43m. \"Following extensive community engagement and detailed assessments, councillors will consider a report recommending a preferred site on 27 February with a motion already tabled to hold a special meeting to consider the issue on 7 March.\" The difference between the qualifications obtained by Scotland's richest and poorest pupils increased last year. Unions said the plans would result in \"devastating cuts\" and called for Edinburgh University to use some of its assets instead. Parents at a nursery in the Borders fear its low child numbers could see it declared \"inactive\". The survey hit the headlines in 2021 after asking pupils as young as 14 about their sexual experiences. Pupil numbers are set to fall by 90,000 by 2040, but ministers want to maintain school staffing. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "The actor who voiced the plucky PC Mukherjee in the latest hit Wallace and Gromit film has said she is pinching herself ahead of a \"quite insane\" trip to the Oscars.",
         "The actor who voiced the plucky PC Mukherjee in the latest hit Wallace and Gromit film has said she is pinching herself ahead of a \"quite insane\" trip to the Oscars. Lauren Patel starred in the BAFTA-winning Vengeance Most Fowl and will travel with cast and creators to the ceremony in Hollywood after the film was nominated for an Academy Award. The long-awaited return of the animated stop-motion franchise from Aardman Animation was watched by 20 million people when the film aired on BBC One on Christmas Day. The 23-year-old, whose character was a firm favourite with fans of the film, said the audience response had been \"so above and beyond what I thought it was going to be\". She told BBC Radio Manchester being involved in the film was an \"incredible experience\", but added that the Oscars call came as a surprise.  \"I woke up, I had like that horrible flu that had been going around and I just had a text from my agent saying, 'oh, you're going to the Oscars in like two weeks',\" she said. \"And I thought I dreamt it in my weird, ill state. \"I don't even really know how it works.  \"And at this point I'm not questioning it. I'm just hoping they'll let me in when I show up.\" The Bolton actor's turn as PC Mukherjee was a high point in the hilarious outing, as the intrepid new PC was central to the plot, helping the iconic title characters track down their penguin nemesis, the master of disguise Feathers McGraw. The film also featured the vocal talents of Patel's fellow Boltonian, comedian Peter Kay, who voiced PC Mukherjee's superior, Ch Insp Mackintosh. Creator and Preston-born Nick Park and his Bristol-based Aardman Animations team have already won four Oscars, so Patel said hopes were high that they would add to that achievement. \"The team are so insanely talented and their minds are brilliant and the script is so witty and so fun,\" she said.  \"It made it such an enjoyable job to work on [and they are] also just all lovely people. \"They've got Oscars and they're very successful, they're very well known.  \"But they're all just really lovely, down to earth people who just want to make the film as good as it can be.\" The trip to the Oscars comes three years after Patel landed her first role in coming-of-age musical drama Everybody's Talking About Jamie.  That success came just days after she was rejected by a number of drama schools and she said she got the part in an open online audition. Since then, she said she \"fell head first\" into the industry, which was \"kind of mental\", and she recently joined the cast of BBC drama Waterloo Road for the latest series. She said becoming a professional actor was a dream come true. \"I never thought that I would be able to do it professionally in this capacity,\" she said. \"I was like, 'oh, maybe I'll go to drama school and then in like 10 years, I'll get a little bit on the telly and, and that'll be great'.  \"And I'll maybe do some community theatre because that's really fun.  \"But yeah, it's mad. I can't believe it. \"Everyone who has ever met me as a child would know that I loved singing and dancing and attention.\" She said she was excited about every aspect of her trip and had chosen her all-important red carpet outfit. \"I wanted to find something that I felt really good in, that I felt represented who I was and I think I found that,\" she said. However, she added that she would keep the exact details of the outfit \"under wraps\". Above everything else though, she said there was one thing she was really looking forward to. \"I'm really excited to see Raye perform,\" she said. \"I love her so much and I've never seen her live and the first time I'm going to see her is at the Oscars, which is mental.\" The 97th Academy Awards will be held in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on Sunday.

         "Cousin marriage: What new evidence tells us about children's ill health",
         "Listen to Sue read this article ",
         "Listen to Sue read this article  In a busy, terraced house in Bradford, three sisters are animatedly chatting. It's a big day at their home: a beautician sits on their sofa, styling their hair and makeup. The room is warm with fun and laughter. It feels like a scene from a Jane Austen novel: three women in their late 20s, each of them bursting with personality, swapping stories. And like most Austen novels, the conversation often turns to marriage. The sisters are preparing for a family wedding at the weekend - where the bride and groom are first cousins. Many people might find this unusual, but in their family and in some parts of Bradford, it's fairly common. Ayesha, who at 29 is the oldest of the three sisters, also married her first cousin in 2017. She has two children with her husband and their marriage is happy, she says. It felt perfectly normal at the time to marry her cousin. Their mother, a Pakistani migrant, assumed it was what all three of her daughters would do. But 26-year-old Salina, the youngest of the three, tells us she broke the mould by having what they call a \"love\" marriage, choosing a partner from outside the family. Salina tells us she is outgoing and ambitious; marrying a cousin simply did not appeal to her. Then there's Mallika, who at 27 is the middle of the three. She's still single and has already decided not to marry within her family. \"I said to my mum that I wouldn't judge my sisters but I wasn't going to do it,\" Mallika tells us. She says having an education has created opportunities for her. \"Before, even if you had an education, you wouldn't be expected to carry on with it. You would be thinking of marriage. Now the mindset is so different.\" In the UK and across Europe, cousin marriage is coming under increased scrutiny - particularly from doctors, who warn that children of first cousins are more likely to experience an array of health problems. And there's now some new, potentially worrying data from Bradford to add into that mix. Researchers at the city's university are entering their 18th year of the Born in Bradford study. It's one of the biggest medical trials of its kind: between 2007 and 2010, researchers recruited more than 13,000 babies in the city and then followed them closely from childhood into adolescence and now into early adulthood. More than one in six children in the study have parents who are first cousins, mostly from Bradford's Pakistani community, making it among the world's most valuable studies of the health impacts of cousin marriage. And in data published in the last few months - and analysed in an upcoming episode of BBC Radio 4's Born in Bradford series -  the researchers found that first cousin-parentage may have wider consequences than previously thought. The most obvious way that a pair of blood-related parents might increase health risks for a child is through a recessive disorder, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.  According to the classic theory of genetics laid out by the biologist Gregor Mendel,  if both parents carry a recessive gene then there's a one in four chance that their child will inherit the condition. And when parents are cousins, they're more likely to both be carriers. A child of first cousins carries a 6% chance of inheriting a recessive disorder, compared to 3% for the general population. But the Bradford study took a much broader view - and sheds fresh light. The researchers weren't just looking at whether a child had been diagnosed with a specific recessive disorder. Instead they studied dozens of data points, observing everything from the children's speech and language development to their frequency of healthcare to their performance at school. Then they used a mathematical model to try to eliminate the impacts of poverty and parental education - so they could focus squarely on the impact on \"consanguinity\", the scientific word for having parents who are related. They found that even after factors like poverty were controlled for, a child of first cousins in Bradford had an 11% probability of being diagnosed with a speech and language problem, versus 7% for children whose parents are not related. They also found a child of first cousins has a 54% chance of reaching a \"good stage of development\" (a government assessment given to all five year-olds in England), versus 64% for children whose parents are not related. We get further insight into their poorer health through the number of visits to the GP. Children of first cousins have a third more primary care appointments than children whose parents are not related - an average of four instead of three a year. What is notable is that even once you account for the children in that group who already have a diagnosed recessive disorder, the figures suggest consanguinity may be affecting even those children who don't have a diagnosable recessive disorder. Neil Small, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford and the author of the study, says that even if all of the children with recessive disorders visited their GP more than average, \"this does not explain the much wider distribution of excess health care usage in the consanguineous children\". The study, he says, is \"exciting because it gives the opportunity for a much more accurate development of a response, targeting interventions and treatments\". It is, of course, just one study, and the population of Bradford is not representative of the whole of the UK. Nevertheless, it adds to a growing concern among scientists that has caught the attention of lawmakers across Europe. Two Scandinavian countries have now moved to outlaw cousin marriage entirely. In Norway, the practice became illegal last year; in Sweden, a ban will come into effect next year. In the UK, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has introduced a private members' bill to outlaw the practice, adding it to the list of illegal marriages (alongside parents, child, siblings, and grandparents). But the Labour government says there are \"no plans\" to impose a ban. At present, the UK is still following the policy of \"genetic counselling\", in which first cousin-couples are educated about the risks of having children, and encouraged to get extra screening in pregnancy. But amid concern about child health and strains on the NHS, some academics are asking whether a beefed-up approach to counselling is needed, with more funding and laser-focused intervention. And there are those who think it's time to follow the Scandinavian example and impose something bound to be difficult and controversial: an outright ban on cousin marriage. For most in the UK, the prospect of marrying a cousin is largely alien. But it wasn't always so unusual. The father of evolution Charles Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Their son, the Victorian scientist Sir George Darwin, went on to estimate that cousin marriages accounted for almost one in 20 aristocratic unions in 19th Century Britain. One of them was Queen Victoria, who married her first cousin, Prince Albert. The novel Wuthering Heights is full of fictional examples. By the 20th Century the proportion of marriages between cousins had declined to about 1%. But it remains a relatively common practice among some South Asian minorities. In three inner-city Bradford wards, almost half (46%) of mothers from the Pakistani community were married to a first or second cousin, according to the most recent Born in Bradford data published two years ago. For those who want to ban the practice, the public health argument is compelling. When announcing his private members' bill in December, Richard Holden highlighted the higher risk of birth defects. Later, on Talk TV, he pointed to data showing that infant mortality rates are higher for children born to cousin parents, with more heart, brain, and kidney problems due to recessive disorders. He also explained that health effects can be \"compounded\" when the practice persists through generations. This risk to child health is one of the reasons Patrick Nash, a researcher and co-founder at the Pharos Foundation research institute, wants to see cousin marriage banned. In a paper published in the Oxford Journal of Law and Religion last year, Nash wrote that a ban would result in \"immediate\" health improvements, especially in communities where the practice is common. He said:  \"Banning cousin marriage would improve public health drastically and have no negative health implications of its own.\" On the ground in Bradford, it's a more mixed picture. Prof Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist and researcher at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, has worked in the city for more than two decades. Over the years he has observed lots of severe genetic disorders. \"I've seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions\". He says it was \"immediately clear\" these conditions were occurring more in Bradford than elsewhere. He remembers some tragic examples: families who lost several children, one after the other, to the same genetic disorder. \"That's very upsetting and very difficult for the family to get their heads around.\" But crucially, Prof Oddie thinks the main risk to genetic health in Bradford is not cousin marriage, but a similar issue known as endogamy, in which people marry members of their close community. In a tight-knit ethnic group, people are more likely to share common ancestors and genes - whether or not they are first cousins, he says. Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK's Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians. \"It's often the case that the exact familial tie can't be traced, but the gene occurs more commonly within a certain group, and for that reason, both parents carry the affected gene,\" Prof Oddie says. \"It's an oversimplification to say that cousin marriage is the root of all excess recessive disorders in Bradford or in Pakistani communities. Endogamy is an important feature.\" Rather than a ban, he stresses the power of education - or what he calls \"genetic literacy\". It's a phrase that crops up again and again from the people we speak to. For many years there's been a campaign in Bradford to inform people in the Pakistani community about their genetic risks. Couples are given specialist advice at their GP; at pregnancy classes, information is shared with expectant mothers. And in Bradford at least, some are taking the message on board. Back at the sisters' house, all three women we interview say that ideas around cousin marriage are slowly changing, in part due to an increased awareness of health risks. They live in the deprived, post-industrial Manningham area of the city. There's a distinct feeling of neighbourliness here. All of the front doors open directly onto the street, which is full of children playing. Occasionally the sounds of their laughter drift inside. \"It has to be something that happens gradually - it's slow, you can't rush it,\" says Salina, the sister who chose to have a love marriage. \"My mum was very young when she came [to the UK from Pakistan]. She had certain views but those changed because she loves us. I just explained to her, 'Mum, how does it benefit you to push cousin marriage?'.\" Mallika, her older sister, agrees. \"It's also to do with social media and being exposed to different people,\" she says. \"You have new connections... contact with people outside our parents' eyes.\" Even Ayesha, the oldest sister who is in a cousin marriage, said she doesn't imagine either of her two children will marry their cousins. At the time she married her cousin, she says, \"I didn't know any different. My parents were strong in their culture. As the generations move on, the culture is disappearing a bit.\" She was aware of the genetic risks when she had her two children. Neither of them have a genetic illness. \"We did take that on board,\" she says, on the topic of genetic health. \"But I always feel like if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. If the child is going to be born with a disability then it will happen if you are married to a cousin or not.\" Indeed, in Bradford at least, the practice is in decline. The share of new mothers from across the Born in Bradford study who were first cousins with the father of their baby fell from 39% in the late 2000s to 27% in the late 2010s. This is no coincidence, according to Professor John Wright, chief investigator on the Born in Bradford project. He points out that it is only recently that his team published evidence around the risks of cousin marriage in the UK. \"When we talked to the families 10 years ago it was very clear that people weren't aware of the risks but like all parents they want to do their best for their children. They want to have healthy children,\" he says. \"Education is the starting point and we've shown in Born in Bradford how powerful that is.\" Aside from health concerns, there's another reason some people want to see cousin marriage banned: its impact on social cohesion. This is what's largely driving the debate in Scandinavia. In Norway, where cousin marriage was banned last year, lawmakers said the practice was linked to forced marriage, with some South Asian immigrant women coerced into unions with relatives. They also looked at the link with so-called \"honour\" violence, according to Tonje Egedius, a journalist who covered the story for a Norwegian newspaper. \"[Police] claim that cousin marriage makes it easier for perpetrators to maintain honour in families,\" she says, \"and that marrying within the family is a contributing cause of honour-related violence and abuse\". Jasmina Holten, a senior Norwegian police officer, said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK last year that some women coerced into cousin marriage found themselves trapped, with financial dependence on relatives. In those cases, divorce often means ostracism. A ban on cousin marriage could break down that abusive chain, she said. Likewise, Sweden's justice secretary Gunnar Str√∂mmer said his own country's ban on cousin marriage will liberate women from \"oppressive standards of honour\". This cultural argument is becoming increasingly prominent. Proponents of a ban broadly see cousin marriage as an instrument of segregation, siphoning people off from the rest of society. Nash, from the Pharos Foundation, says that a ban on cousin marriage would help reduce ethnic segregation in places like Bradford. Others are sceptical of the idea that you can force people to integrate through the sharp stick of legislation. They say that even if a ban goes ahead, some couples would continue to marry their cousins through illegal, unregistered unions - and that women in those marriages may feel they no longer have the protection of the state if the relationship goes sour. Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, tells us that \"thoughtful legislation\" would \"offer protections\" to people coerced into cousin marriage. \"[But] we must respect cultural diversity and personal choice,\" he says. \"Cousin marriage is an important cultural practice in many parts of the world, and legislation should be sensitive to the social and familial values that underlie it.\" More broadly, he suggests governments may want to think about boosting education and genetic screening for couples entering cousin marriage - rather than imposing \"blanket bans\". For some, the idea of an outright ban raises the ugly image of certain minorities being targeted over others. Karma Nirvana, a charity that works to end honour-based abuse, described the backbench attempt to ban cousin marriage as \"a tool of political point-scoring, inciting hate and driving a wedge between communities\". Richard Holden's bill is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. Without government support it has never been likely to pass but its very existence and events in Scandinavia have resulted in cousin marriage being talked about far beyond the communities where it is prevalent. Of course, for those Britons in a cousin marriage, life goes on much as before. Back at the Bradford house, the beautician is putting her finishing touches to the hair of the three sisters, ahead of their big wedding at the weekend. Ayesha, the sister who is in a cousin marriage, is reflective and thoughtful about her own near decade-long relationship. \"There are difficulties - we've been through lots together, we have sacrificed a lot,\" she says about her husband. \"But we are happy together.\" \"I think even with love marriages you're going to have problems. They'll just be different ones.\"  Top image credit: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Weronika had suffered a rare complication - unusual retrograde amnesia. She couldn't recall events or people from her past life. Her memories never returned. \"I only know from what my parents have told me,\" Weronika told BBC Scotland News. \"The doctors were checking if I knew them - I remember so many faces I hadn't seen before. \"On the way home it was petrifying ‚Äì getting in a car was scary. I was just going along with what I was told to do. \"It felt like I was going home with strangers who said they were my mum and dad ‚Äì my mum was showing me my room they had done up for me for after my surgery ‚Äì but none of it looked like it belonged to me. \"I remember looking at my clothes and thinking who would wear this?\" Weronika, from Prestonpans near Edinburgh, said she knew it was ok to be there, but said her whole personality, and her family relationships, changed. She said: \"They never lost that connection with me, but even now, I don't think my relationship is as close as they would want it ‚Äì I am more isolated and have been my own person since the surgery. \"My parents kept showing me photo albums ‚Äì and that really annoyed me - they were talking and laughing about things I did when I was younger but no matter how hard I tried to focus on it, I got nothing. \"I didn't like looking at photos with them because they have emotional attachment to these moments and I don't.\" Weronika had to re-learn everything - starting with primary school maths and English. She said it took little time to re-learn as after the lessons were taught, the memory of that seemed to be unlocked - she learned her times tables after going over them twice. Back at high school, she struggled. She did not recognise any of her friends, and, starting over, she gravitated to different people. After a decade of monitoring, Weronika's tumour started to grow slowly, and in March last year, the time had come for action. Weronika - now 25 and about to be married - needed surgery.  And one of her first thoughts was - would she lose her memory again? \"I was devastated,\" she said. \"The surgeon said it was definitely possible that it could happen again. But the tumour was deeper this time and I needed the surgery to improve my life expectancy.\" Weronika's treatment is followed in the new series of Surgeons: At the Edge of Life on BBC Two. In the seventh series, which follows surgeons in NHS Lothian, consultant neurosurgeon Imran Liaquat explains the jeopardy of the complicated procedure. The tumour is in the right frontal lobe of Weronika's brain ‚Äì the area responsible for abstract thought, creativity and concentration.  He will have to identify what is tumour and what is normal tissue then resect - or cut - around it without taking tissue that would affect brain function. Mr Liaquat said: \"Preserving cognitive function is very important - it's the essence of who we are as an individual and that can be disrupted by surgeons. We carry the complications and push the barriers of optimal resection and that does bear on you.\" He added that it was imperative to remove as much as possible. \"Evidence for tumours like Weronikas is that we need to remove at least 80-90% of the tumour to add survival advantage.\" Assisting in the operating theatre is the man who performed Weronika's original surgery when she was a teenager - consultant neurosurgeon Drahoslav Sokol. Mr Sokol said: \"It's not easy to think about doing another surgery, particularly in the context of her previous complication but we really need to remove her tumour to prevent further problems in the future.\" Weronika was terrified she would wake up and not know who her fiance Cameron was. \"The fear was that the last time it happened it changed who I was ‚Äì what if I don't actually like him?\" But Cameron took it in his stride, making photographic memory books and scrapbooks of their relationship and writing notes and letters to his fiancee. He said: \"She means everything to me - absolutely everything. If she was to lose her memory I would just have to make her fall in love with me all over again and take it from there.\" Practically, Weronika wrote down all her banking details and passwords, organised a will, and wrote a letter to her partner for the worst-case scenario. Coming round from her operation, the room held its breath. \"I woke up and everyone was there ‚Äì this time around I didn't feel like I had a surgery, I felt like I had a nap,\" Weronika said. \"My family were in pieces the whole time.  \"But I was completely aware and I knew exactly what happened. I was able to talk. \"I saw Imran and I remember saying 'I still remember you'.\" Weronika is recovering well and married Cameron in December. She is looking forward to a happy life after 100% of the tumour was removed and she is indebted to the two men who made it happen. \"I don't think I could express my gratitude to those two surgeons enough,\" she said. \"This is the second time they have saved my life. \"When you watch it you realise what goes into it and they are like gods  - they are amazing.\" The rural holiday retreat near Pickering will be a \"lifeline\" for those affected, they say. Eight-year-old Dulcie Dulcie was diagnosed with a stage four neuroblastoma in 2021. It is the first time in five years that more businesses have been added to the ONS register than removed.

         "'Putin will strike again' and Starmer heads to DC",
         "",
         " \"He'll strike again\" is the headline in the Daily Mirror, which leads with Sir Keir Starmer's warning about Vladimir Putin. The Times says the prime minister will appeal to Donald Trump to \"hold back\" Russia, as he arrives in Washington at what the Guardian calls \"the most precarious moment for European stability in decades\". The i newspaper says the UK's \"top Trump card\" will be raising the prospect of a state visit to London, hosted by King Charles III.  The Daily Mail reports the \"historic White House summit\" will also include discussions about the UK's plans to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. The Sun calls on Trump to veto the \"inexplicable and insane deal\". According to the Daily Telegraph, American officials are also expected to bring up concerns about a \"Chinese mega-embassy\" planned for London. Analysis by the Financial Times suggests that nearly half of the newly reduced aid budget is on track to be spent on housing asylum seekers in the UK. One Labour backbencher describes it as a \"horrendous waste of taxpayer money\", while another official tells the paper that \"the actual figure spent on aid is going to be really, really small\". A job advert for an NHS doctor to care for \"older people stuck in A&E corridors\" is highlighted in the Telegraph. It reports that the ad says corridor care is \"now normal\" at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. But health leaders tell the Times the listing is a \"frightening and worrying indictment of how bad things have become\". The front page of the Daily Star features screenshots from what it calls a \"bonkers\" AI-generated video shared online by Trump, which the paper says depicts Gaza as a \"glitzy Dubai-style paradise\". The video shows a giant gold statue of Trump, as well as a shirtless Israeli prime minister enjoying a cocktail on a beach.  The Daily Express says the post has \"sparked fury\" - with the president's own supporters describing it as being \"in very poor taste\". The Times reports the government is carrying out a pilot in which wind turbines will be painted black, to try to reduce the number of birds killed by their blades. Officials are said to have pointed to studies which suggest the change could bring down bird collisions by 70%. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "More councils agree tax increases of up to 13%",
         "Councils with a combined population of more than a million people have agreed council tax rises of up to 13% following the lifting of a nationwide freeze.",
         "Councils with a combined population of more than a million people have agreed council tax rises of up to 13% following the lifting of a nationwide freeze. Councillors in Stirling, Renfrewshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Dundee, Argyll and Bute, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Clackmannanshire and Dumfries and Galloway have been meeting to confirm their plans. The biggest agreed percentage increase  of the day came in the smallest authority with Clackmannanshire councillors voting for a 13% rise. Tax rates have been frozen or capped for much of the past two decades but with no such restrictions in place many areas have already seen rises well above the latest inflation rate of 3%. Protesters gathered outside some of the meetings to make known their concerns about potential cuts or spending proposals in their areas. The 13% rise came in Clackmannanshire and was agreed by 11 votes to six. It will see the charge on a band D property go from ¬£1,410.96 to ¬£1,594.38. It could still be surpassed by proposals in Orkney for a 15% rise. Another big increase came in Angus with 11% agreed taking the band D level to ¬£1,461.52 which the council highlighted was still one of the lowest in the country.  Councillors in Aberdeenshire also backed a double-figure percentage rise of 10%. The motion was passed 43 votes to 21 for a rival proposal, with one no vote and takes the annual bill for a band D premises to ¬£1,532.76. The council also approved indicative increases of 8% for both 2026/27, and 2027/28. Argyll and Bute Council agreed a 9.9% rise to ¬£1,625.64 on a band D home. Leader Jim Lynch said: \"Setting the council's budget has been extremely difficult. \"We all use council services every day, but every year council budgets face multi-million pound gaps. \"Decisions made today protect the council services we all rely on from drastic budget cuts, and make investment possible in services that we know matter to local people.\" In Renfrewshire, a 9.5% rise was agreed (taking band D properties to ¬£1,572,61 for 2025/26) while Stirling Council voted 12 to 11 for an 8.8% rise (¬£1,611.87 on band D from ¬£1,481.50). The increase in East Ayrshire was set at 8% (¬£1,606.44 on band D) with the same percentage rise in South Ayrshire (¬£1,569.41) and Dundee (¬£1,605.34). After a lengthy meeting, Dumfries and Galloway councillors voted through spending plans which will see a 9% rise (¬£1,454.91). Local authorities say the increases are necessary, despite an improved Scottish government settlement, in order to safeguard services after many years of restricted funding. In the current financial year, the government subsidised a nationwide council tax freeze but that ends in April. Other than 2023-24 - when many councils raised rates by about 5% - this is the first time for almost 20 years when a big increase has really been possible. The Scottish government says it is dealing with \"enormous financial pressures\" but is \"investing in, and supporting, local authorities\". It said there was an extra ¬£1bn of funding for councils in its 2025/26 budget - taking the total government grant to about ¬£15bn. Last week, tax rises up to 10% were confirmed for another group of councils with a combined population of about two million.  The latest round means that the majority of the 32 Scottish authorities have now agreed increases which range from 6% in South Lanarkshire up to a proposed 15% in Orkney. Councillors voted for the rise by 11 votes to six at the council's annual budget meeting Bristol City Council has agreed its annual budget, with a 4.99% increase in council tax. Annual bills for an average band D property would be ¬£1,527.09 if the increase is approved.  The new council tax settlement means a band D property will pay ¬£1,528.44. The rise was agreed following a marathon eight-hour debate at County Hall in Trowbridge. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "There is not enough funding available to deliver a number of major infrastructure projects, NI Water has said.  ",
         "There is not enough funding available to deliver a number of major infrastructure projects, NI Water has said.   It says the severity of wastewater and drainage development constraints will increase as a result.   The company plans to set out the implications of deferring the Living With Water Plan (LWWP) for Belfast, a ¬£1.9bn programme, next month. The decision means work to upgrade sewage works at Sydenham, Whitehouse and Kinnegar cannot proceed, and works planned at Glenmachan, Greenisland, Carrickfergus and on the sea outfalls will not start.   NI Water says it will begin a programme of maintenance this spring to \"ensure the existing facility operates as effectively as possible\". Last year, the former Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd said an estimated 50% increase in the cost of the plan was not affordable. When LWWP was published in 2015, it set out three objectives:  The lack of wastewater infrastructure has been a longstanding concern of developers who said it was preventing economic growth in the city. Drainage in Belfast was originally designed by Victorian engineers as a combined system, with both sewage and storm water flowing through the same pipes. That was due to the shape of the city, sitting at the bottom of hills at near-sea level. In a statement, NI Water said in late 2024, the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) had carried out a review of the LWWP and concluded the original 12-year scale is \"no longer achievable\". It added that the delivery cannot be taken through a formal programme, but will instead need to be carried out by individual partners, such as NI Water, at a \"scale and pace achievable within available budgets\". \"The projects included within the Living With Water in Belfast Plan... are major infrastructure upgrades which require significant and sustained investment over a number of years which is currently not available to NI Water,\" it added. \"Therefore, the projects have been paused indefinitely.\" The Department for Economy says the purchase of Timber Quay is key to boosting students in Derry. Ministers agree on the programme one day after a decision on the finalised document was postponed.

         "Extra defence cash could be spent in Wales - minister",
         "Wales could benefit from plans to boost the UK's spending on defence, a treasury minister has said.",
         "Wales could benefit from plans to boost the UK's spending on defence, a treasury minister has said. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would boost military budgets to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, funded by cuts to foreign aid. On a visit to Airbus, in Newport, Darren Jones said it was a \"great opportunity for the UK economy, including here in Wales\". Finance Secretary for Wales, Mark Drakeford, said he expects a \"share\" of the extra cash to be spent in the country. More than 160 companies supporting the defence sector have operations based in Wales, employing over 20,000 people. Firms include BAE Systems, which has a munitions facility in Monmouthshire, and General Dynamics, which is constructing its AJAX armoured vehicles in Merthyr Tydfil. On Thursday Jones and Drakeford visited Airbus's complex on the outskirts of Newport, which provides security systems for the Ministry of Defence and other private companies. The treasury minister is on a tour of the UK ahead of the spending review - a major announcement which will set out how the government allocates cash for public services. Asked if Wales could benefit from the defence announcement the chief secretary to the Treasury, told BBC Wales: \"Yes. \"Potentially we are spending more money on defence companies and defence technologies, which is a great opportunity for the UK economy, including here in Wales.\" He said there would be \"plenty\" of opportunities for businesses and workers at firms including Airbus. \"We've got the strategic defence review happening at the moment, the spending review will be concluded in June. Once we've done all of that, decided the strategy and the budget we will then just be getting on with spending that money.\" Drakeford said: \"Wales already makes a larger proportionate contribution than other parts of the UK to our armed forces.  \"We would certainly be able to see Wales get its share of a very important additional investment.\" Asked how he felt about the cuts to international aid to fund the military, the former first minister added: \"There are some very difficult decisions. \"The world is changing around us and not changing in a way where it is easy to see how the pieces will all eventually fall.\" He said Sir Keir faced a \"difficult balancing act\". The visit came ahead of meeting between Jones, Drakeford and finance ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland.  On wider UK government spending, Drakeford said he did not find it \"frustrating\" that there was divergence between the two Labour-run governments. Issues include High Speed 2 rail, which the Welsh government says should generate a financial benefit for Wales, and on the devolution of the Crown Estate. \"I think it is natural and normal,\" said Drakeford. \"The responsibility for the Welsh government is to speak up for the things we know to be important here in Wales.\" Drakeford said the Welsh government continues \"to have very productive discussions\" on rail, where there is hope the UK government will invest in new stations. Jones said he did not want to be \"relitigating the arguments of a past Conservative government\". But he said there was a \"shared ambition\" over rail investment. The prime minister announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027. The PM will head to Washington a day after announcing military budgets would rise to 2.5% of national income by 2027. It comes as ministers face pressure to set out defence plans after talks begin to end war in Ukraine. Nato expects 23 of its 32 members to have met the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence in 2024.

         "An investigation into a serious incident involving a plane attempting to land in fog found \"confusion and miscommunication\" between the crew. A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility. The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb. It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport. The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident. Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or \"wet lease\" provider. A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted. It added: \"We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident. \"We are very glad all those involved are safe and the safety and welfare of our customers and crew is always our priority. We will work closely with regulatory bodies and ACMI operators accordingly.\" Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook. Send your story ideas to channel.islands@bbc.co.uk. Concerns have been raised about noise, local infrastructure and the potential environmental impact.

         "Manx back-up freight vessel MV Arrow will operate a year-long charter in the Channel Islands, the government-owned ferry firm has confirmed. Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the agreement would come into force on 24 March, after the return of the Ben-my-Chree from dry dock. The Steam Packet said the vessel would undergo port trials and pilotage training before entering service. Danish ferry operator DFDS confirmed the MV Arrow would act as the firm's main freight vessel for the Jersey to Portsmouth route from 28 March. Currently based in Douglas, the MV Arrow can carry 66 14m (46ft) trailers and accommodate 12 passengers. It was bought by the Steam Packet for about ¬£8m in 2022 as a back-up freight vessel for the island's then flagship ferry, the Ben-my-Chree. While it has remained an option for the firm since the arrival of the Manxman in July 2023, under the company's sea services agreement with the Manx government the former flagship ferry must be retained for back-up passenger and freight services. Jersey's government signed a contract with DFDS to operate ferry services in the Channel Islands in December. On March 28 the Danish firm is set to take over the contract from previous provider Condor Ferries, which had also used the MV Arrow to increase freight capacity. It will travel to Teeside for its own dry-docking before its charter with DFDS following the return of the Ben-my-Chree to Manx waters next month. Steam Packet managing director Brian Thomson said the year-long charter would take place while the firm \"future fleet strategy\" was agreed, he said. A committee of Manx politicians recently recommended a new sea services framework should be developed for the Isle of Man by the end of 2025. A spokesman for DFDS said the MV Arrow would be the main freight vessel for the Portsmouth route, alongside its RoPax vessel Stena Vinga, which would provide freight and passenger capacity. The Danish firm said it was making a \"considerable investment\" into its fleet to provide \"modern and comfortable accommodation\" through a refurbishment of the fast ferry Levante Jet, which would service the Jersey to Poole route from April.

         "A woman living in Ukraine said she is \"very grateful\" for the support of people from Guernsey.",
         "A woman living in Ukraine said she is \"very grateful\" for the support of people from Guernsey. Natalia Polischuk, from Kyiv, has shared her thanks on the day that marked three years since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.  Islanders have stepped up to help in many ways, including knitting and sending thousands of baby hats, taking on daring challenges to raise funds, and even driving to and from the borders to deliver vital aid. Marc Laine, who delivered small generators to Ukraine, said he felt compelled to help residents of the country. He said: \"The first time we went [to Ukraine], we took generators and we were welcomed everywhere - there was a lot of comradery. \"I was inspired by everyone we met - if they weren't involved directly in the conflict, they were doing something to help in their own time, there was so much enthusiasm. \"People in Guernsey have been great, Humanitarian Aid Guernsey are fantastic - they have shipped massive donations from the public to Ukraine.\" Ms Polischuk said: \"I think the support is important and we are very grateful for the people of Guernsey. \"I do believe that the generators saved numerous lives in the winters - a lot of places was out of electricity for hours. \"Those generators helped to sustain schools, kindergartens, hospitals - I know that Marc and his team brought smaller generators which helped military hospitals. \"The support is greatly appreciated - the fact that many people from around the world helped... that was huge.\" Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

         "Southport attack yoga teacher: 'If I didn't get out, everyone was going to die'",
         "A yoga teacher who almost died in the Southport attack has described for the first time the desperate moments when she helped several children run to safety, despite having been stabbed five times.",
         "A yoga teacher who almost died in the Southport attack has described for the first time the desperate moments when she helped several children run to safety, despite having been stabbed five times. Leanne Lucas told BBC Panorama how she called 999 as the attacker chased after them. \"I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die,\" she said. A 13-year-old helping to run the class, whom we are calling Sarah, also told the BBC that attacker Axel Rudakubana looked \"possessed\" as he stabbed her. Leanne and Sarah are the first survivors who escaped the room to speak publicly. Ten people were injured and three children were killed in the attack last July. Sarah - who is now 14 and whose identity is protected by a court order - was seriously wounded but managed to lead several other children, including her younger sister, to safety. Sitting alongside her parents, she told us how another \"incredible\" girl, who appeared to be only about 10 years old, was keeping other children calm, telling them: \"Don't worry, your parents are going to be here, everything's going to be OK.\" The two survivors of the attack, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop, recounted how they had helped others escape the terrifying violence and how neighbours had rushed to their aid. They also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including messages on social media blaming Leanne for the deaths. Leanne and Sarah both expressed shock at how authorities had missed warning signs about the attacker. \"It's so shocking how much evidence they had on him, how he slipped through the net,\" said Leanne. \"You see the best and the worst at the same time,\" said Sarah, who described seeing \"the evil side of people\" in Rudakubana's violence and \"all the good of all the community coming together as well to help everyone\". With the mammoth Eras tour reaching the UK, the summer of 2024 was Taylor Swift's summer. So when children's yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, organised a workshop themed around the singer, it sold out within a week. Twenty-five little girls, the youngest five years old, signed up for a morning of dancing, yoga, and making friendship bracelets at the Hart Space studio on 29 July. Sarah offered to help the two teachers and took photos at the event. As the session was drawing to a close, Leanne gathered all of the children together. \"We went round the circle and they said how they were feeling and one of the little girls said: 'This is the best day of my life',\" Leanne said. The girl, nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, died later that night. Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were also killed in the attack. Rudakubana, the killer, had arrived by taxi, wearing a bright green hoodie and a medical face mask that covered his mouth. Dashcam footage shows him trying a locked door at the Hart Space before walking through an open doorway and heading up the stairs. Leanne saw the attacker briefly through the window, but she had no idea who he was ‚Äì or that he posed a threat. The next thing she knew, he was in the room. \"He opened the door and grabbed a child. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't see anything. He then grabbed the next child, and the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'\" Sarah was one of the first to be attacked. \"I saw him stab a child in front of me. And then I saw the knife coming towards me and him coming towards me,\" she said. \"And that's when I saw it go into my arm. And that's when I turned and he must have got my back, but I didn't feel it at the time, because of the adrenaline.\" The attacker made his way through the room, before reaching their teacher. \"He moves through the girls by the table and moves next to me,\" Leanne told us, reliving the scene in her mind. \"I just felt something go in my back and my brain just said ‚Äì he got me.\" Leanne suffered five stab wounds ‚Äì to her spine, her head, her ribs, her lung, and her shoulder blade. Despite this, she managed to get herself and several of the girls out of the room and call the police. \"I just knew that if I didn't get out everyone was going to die,\" she told us, wiping tears from her eyes. \"He was bigger than me. And I just thought: I need to get some help. So we all run towards the door. We were shouting: 'Run!' I called 999 on the landing and I asked for the police.\" She said she then saw a flash of green - the attacker's hoodie - \"and I go into panic mode and he's chasing us\". It's clear that more children would have died if the teachers and Sarah hadn't taken the action they did. At Rudakubana's sentencing, the judge said Leanne \"tried to save as many children as she could\" while being attacked, and that \"she did all she could before escaping\". Leanne says: \"The police said we'd all be dead if me and Heidi [fellow organiser] hadn't done what we'd done and that gives nothing for the children who did die... that doesn't take that away.\" But like many of those who saved lives that day, she still torments herself. Sarah was left with life-threatening injuries and fractures to two of her spinal vertebrae. \"I remember seeing the girls all like huddling around the stairs,\" she told us calmly. \"So I remember shouting for them to get down and get out. So I was physically pushing them down the stairs to get everyone out. \"I thought that he wasn't going to stop until he killed everyone. I thought that he wanted to kill us all.\" Despite her injuries, Sarah managed to lead several other children out of the Hart Space, up the driveway and across the street, where local resident Steve was fixing his garden wall. Sarah told him she had been stabbed and thought she was dying, but Steve reassured her and led the children into his house. \"Everyone was in a blind panic,\" Sarah told us. Steve describes Sarah as \"a hero\". \"She led all them kids away.\" He and his wife began taking care of the children. One of the girls who had been stabbed was \"tiny\", Steve recalled, and he could see others were injured too. Meanwhile, James Dixon had heard the screams while working at the garage next door to the Hart Space. \"As a parent, you can tell the difference between a scream of play and a scream of terror,\" he said. \"And this was ‚Äì nightmares, pain. They were terrified.\" A parent was in her car, calling the police, with five or six children in the back. One appeared to be seriously injured. James ran over to another child who had collapsed. \"She asked me: 'Am I going to die?' Which just breaks your heart, but I told her no,\" he said. She was so badly injured he was afraid his reassurance might not be true. \"I focused everything on her to make sure to keep her alive.\" James saved the seven-year-old girl's life. Two more workers from the garage, Colin Parry and Julian Medlock, had rushed over to help. They saw Leanne, leaning against a car, \"completely in shock\", said Colin. He asked her if she needed help, but she told him: \"Just look after the girls. Just look after the girls.\" \"My brain is going 100 miles an hour but my body won't do anything,\" Leanne recalled. \"And there are people asking me questions and I am saying: 'Go and get the children.' \"I just don't know what else I could have done,\" she said. At the same time, window cleaner Joel Verite had spotted Leanne as he was driving past on his round. He screeched to a halt and saw her point up to the studio, saying that a man was stabbing children up there. Businessman Jon Hayes, who had been working in an adjoining office, had also been stabbed after confronting the attacker. Joel raced inside, shouting as he climbed the stairs. He saw Rudakubana standing at the top of the staircase. \"We locked eyes for a brief second. He's got a knife,\" Joel said. \"My life flashed before my eyes. Who else is with him? Who is going to come behind me?\" Steve had run over from his house, armed with hammers. He met Joel, who had stepped back from the staircase after facing off with the knifeman. \"We had a little chat to ourselves and said, right, are we going to go in and do him or what?\" Steve said. But at that moment, the police arrived. They entered the studio with a Taser, subdued Rudakubana and arrested him. Steve said he saw the police knocking on the locked door of one of the toilets. Inside was Heidi Liddle, Leanne's friend. After helping some of the children escape, she had found an eight-year-old girl hiding in a toilet and had saved her by locking them both inside. It was now noon - the time when the workshop had been due to end - and the street had filled with distraught parents looking for their children. Sarah's dad arrived and saw Joel carrying a child. \"My initial thought was, God - and I just ran for the building,\" he told us. But Steve was telling parents that many of the children were sheltering at his house. There, the door was open and his youngest daughter came out. \"I just gripped tight, ever so hard. She goes, 'I'm fine. I'm fine'.\" Still outside the Hart Space studio, Sarah's mum saw \"blood everywhere\". \"There were bloody hands on cars,\" she said. \"When I looked up, I just saw my husband at the end of the street. He was waving me over and I just ran towards him. I just tried not to look at anything or anyone.\" Leanne and eight children - including Sarah - were treated for life-threatening injuries. \"I asked someone if I was going to die,\" Leanne said. \"And she didn't say no. She's just said 'you're in the best place'.\" Leanne said she heard someone discuss possible paralysis and something about her lungs. Sarah was taken to the same hospital, where her father was told they had had to operate on her lung, which had collapsed from a puncture wound. While Leanne recovered from life-saving surgery, rioting began, first in Southport, then spreading across the UK, following false rumours that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. She said she was targeted on social media by people who blamed her for the children's deaths. \"I just was scared of everybody. And still thinking it was all my fault. If I hadn't arranged the day, if I had never advertised in certain places, if I hadn't used that studio,\" she said. She saw videos of riots taking place on her own street. \"I was like, are they trying to get me?\" Sarah told us \"disinformation\" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story - \"to get my voice and the truth out there to everyone\". Others who acted bravely on that day share Leanne's sense of disbelief and turmoil. \"Those screams haunt me,\" says James, who saved a seven-year-old girl's life. \"I'd think to myself, if I ran a little bit quicker, a little bit braver, took a weapon...\" We first met Leanne in January. She had endured six months of waiting for her attacker to be tried. But on the day his trial was due to begin, Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to three charges of murder and 10 of attempted murder. For Leanne, this was another act of malice. \"I found out he pleaded guilty on the news,\" Leanne recalled. \"I felt so angry. We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say guilty and put every single family, victim, witness - everyone in that position.\" For many witnesses in the case, Rudakubana's last-minute guilty plea ‚Äì however manipulative in its timing ‚Äì was a relief. Many were dreading the prospect of sitting in a courtroom with their attacker while lawyers pored over the details of the injuries he had inflicted. Sarah, however, wanted her day in court, saying she'd had all the \"stress and anxiety\" without the \"closure\". Rudakubana was sentenced to 52 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed because he was 17 years old when he carried out the attack. Leanne said she wanted to speak out now because, even after the court proceedings, she still did not feel the \"absolute trauma\" of that day had been understood. \"I just feel like I am able to be the voice of people you can't hear who are involved in the story,\" she said. On the day her attacker was sentenced, Leanne spoke about the survivor's guilt she lives with. \"I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died,\" she told the court. She said she was struggling to trust others and trying to see the goodness in the world. \"For Alice, Elsie, Bebe, Heidi and the surviving girls, I'm surviving for you,\" she said. She told us about treasured moments with each of the girls who died. She described Bebe's \"pure excitement\" at holding a puppy during a puppy yoga session. The day of the attack was the first time Leanne had met Alice, and the \"beautiful smile\" of this \"confident ballerina\" left an impression. And she recalled Elsie's enthusiasm for the weekly reading and writing lessons they had together. It is clear that their memory is what keeps her going. \"These children represent goodness, I think. Just pure goodness,\" she told us. \"Happiness. How genuine they were. Positive. The love of life and just making the best out of every single moment. That's how I remember them.\" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.¬†¬†The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.¬†Read about our approach to external linking. ¬†"

         "A former aide to the Prince of Wales has said the royal was at his \"lowest\" after the Princess of Wales was diagnosed with cancer.",
         "A former aide to the Prince of Wales has said the royal was at his \"lowest\" after the Princess of Wales was diagnosed with cancer. In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Jason Knauf, formerly the chief executive of William and Kate's Royal Foundation, said: \"It was awful, absolutely awful. It's the lowest I've ever seen him. \"Within a couple of weeks, if you're Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer. I couldn't believe it.\" Both the King and the Princess of Wales were treated for cancer last year. Kate is now in remission and Charles is having ongoing treatment. Mr Knauf, 43, stepped down from his position at the end of 2021. Catherine's diagnosis was made public in March last year, and Mr Knauf said: \"The problem was that all this crazy conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. 'Was she really ill?'. \"But they didn't want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn't told the children and they were still working through how to tell the children.\" Speaking to reporters last year at the end of his visit to South Africa, Prince William,  42, talked about how he has coped after both his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer, describing the past year as the \"hardest year\" of his life. \"It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,\" he said after being asked how his year has been after a difficult year for the Royal Family.\" Mr Knauf also previously worked for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In October 2018, while working for the couple as their communications secretary, Mr Knauf made a bullying complaint against Meghan. He wrote of his concerns to William's then private secretary in an email, in an apparent attempt to force Buckingham Palace to protect staff. The duchess's legal team strenuously denied the allegation. Discussing William's relationship with Harry, Mr Knauf said: \"It's very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye, but he's chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same. \"But I will say, of course, it's been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them. \"I worked really closely with the two of them and we had lots of great times.\" Mr Knauf has previously expressed regret in not giving evidence in the Duchess of Sussex's High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal. Meghan won her privacy case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) in 2021, when the High Court found its publication of her letter to her father - sent in August 2018 - was unlawful. Mr Knauf was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in the 2023 New Year Honours List. Before joining the royal household the American-born former corporate affairs executive worked for a range of institutions, from the office of the New Zealand prime minister to HM Treasury and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Knauf led a review of the Royal Foundation's role and structure from March 2019, before becoming its chief executive in September of that year. He oversaw the launch of the Foundation's Earthshot Prize - William's ¬£50 million environmental prize, now an independent charity, which recognises solutions, ideas and technologies that \"repair the planet\".

         "The writer of a Bergerac reboot said he wanted to develop the leading role to make it \"more complex\". The Jersey-based detective series originally ran on BBC One from 1981 to 1991 and starred John Nettles. Toby Whithouse, born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said he had tried to make the show more \"labyrinth\" and wanted to \"test and challenge\" the character of Jim. Set to premiere on 27 February, the new series stars Damien Molony, alongside Zo√´ Wanamaker and Philip Glenister. The show followed a maverick detective and recovering alcoholic adept at solving complex crimes.  Nettles became a household name due to its success and said he was offered a cameo role but turned it down. Mr Whithouse, whose previous work includes Doctor Who, wanted \"to stay true\" to the programme's roots while offering something new. He said: \"I absolutely wanted to do something that was more complex and more labyrinth and also allowed us to then to develop Jim as a character and to test and challenge him. \"So fans of the original will go away feeling like the show has been respected, and new people, who have come with no baggage or expectations, still really enjoy it.\" He told BBC Essex the writing process was far from easy as it was unlike anything he had written before. \"I don't really tend to do police procedure shows, I do more high-concept genres. \"I started to have an idea for the main character and how I would write him and reinvent him. \"In the original show, Jim Bergerac was a recovering alcoholic, which is something that I really wanted to use but we've taken it in a slightly different, more realistic direction.\" One of the key changes in the modern version is there will be one story per series instead of one story per week.

         "Three people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a man who went missing more than 20 years ago. Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer in Scotland a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police said it had now arrested two men, in their 40s and 50s, as well as a woman in her 40s on suspicion of murder. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Police are still searching an address in the Coronation Street area which is a location Mr Clive is known to have visited on the evening he went missing. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were \"still in limbo\" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said: \"We are doing everything we can to provide Scott's family with the answers they deserve. \"We still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community.\" He said: \"I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott's movements that night, to come forward. \"The information you have could prove key in our investigations.\" Follow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

         "More struggling councils to sell assets and borrow cash",
         "The government has agreed to relax budgeting rules for a record 29 English councils to allow them to balance their books next year.",
         "The government has agreed to relax budgeting rules for a record 29 English councils to allow them to balance their books next year. The authorities will be allowed to use Treasury loans or cash from selling assets to cover day-to-day spending, which they are normally banned from doing. The figure is up from 19 that requested such flexibility this year, further underscoring the continued financial fragility of the sector. Ministers will, however, encourage councils not to sell off \"community and heritage assets\" to help meet current spending pressures. It remains to be seen what this means in practice, with the government leaving it to authorities to decide which assets meet this definition.  Councils in England will have ¬£69.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year. But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years. On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective ¬£1.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic. Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions. They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year. Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton. Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022. The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs. Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online. They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment. The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in \"partnership - not punishment\". The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending. London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a \"short-term measure\" that \"leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about\".  The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing. Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing. They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally. They have promised the new formula will take into account the \"impact of rurality\" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Conservative-run councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being unfairly funded. The rise was agreed following a marathon eight-hour debate at County Hall in Trowbridge. Andrew Jefferies says he is \"passing on the baton\" as the local authority works on devolution plan.  The county council wants all services in Suffolk to be provided by one unitary authority.  Ashley Baxter, leader of South Kesteven District Council, suggests merging with Rutland. Chelmsford City Council figures for 2025/26 do not include the forthcoming local government changes. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "A tribute bench found on a beach 80 miles from where it was washed into the sea during a storm is set to be reunited with a family - who say the \"heartwarming\" effort of locals to track them down \"restores your faith in people\". The wooden seat made in tribute to Warrington man Bill Batcock was pulled into the Irish Sea off Anglesey in December, before travelling 80 miles (130km) and resurfacing on the Cumbrian coast. It was stumbled upon by members of a local Facebook group who tracked down the man's daughter, Helen Wharton, to tell her the bench had been found. \"Dad was such an adventurer, to think he's made a break for it to go on another adventure, it just makes me smile really,\" she said. Ms Wharton said she and her family had \"no idea\" the bench had gone missing during Storm Darragh in December.  She said she was shocked to receive a message on social media with an image of the bench wedged between sand dunes on Drigg beach near Seascale, Cumbria, asking: \"Is this yours?\" \"I couldn't believe it, it was all so strange,\" said Ms Wharton, who lives in Padgate, Warrington. The bench was erected on some exposed headland at Bull Bay on Anglesey to commemorate Mr Batcock, a lover of the Welsh coast and mountains, who died of leukaemia in 2018. He asked for the bench to be placed there \"as he wanted to look out across the sea, across the coast and mountains, towards home\", she said.  Words from one of his poems had been inscribed on a plaque on the bench, which read: \"For me, it has to be the sea.\" Ms Wharton told BBC Radio Manchester the message was now \"quite ironic\" given the remarkable journey of the bench. She said the campaign to return the bench was \"really lovely\", adding the words on the plaque had intrigued local people. Megan O'Gorman, who runs the local Facebook group in which a member messaged to say they had found the bench, said she was determined to track down the family.  \"I thought right, who is this person, where has this bench travelled from,\" she said. Ms Wharton said: \"It's just typical if you think of my dad, nothing would tie him down.\" She and her family plan to travel to Cumbria on Friday to collect the bench and return it to its home on Anglesey.

         "Two people have been arrested in a series of police raids in Dundee as the result of an investigation into county lines drug dealing and human trafficking. A 63-year-old man was arrested in the Stobswell area of Dundee shortly after 07:15 following a raid by specialist officers. Four hours later, a 23-year-old woman was arrested after officers raided a flat in the Hilltown. A 26-year-old man has also been arrested by police in the West Midlands following simultaneous raids in Birmingham and Wolverhampton.     Police officers remain at both properties following the arrests, which were made as the result of intelligence gathered as part of the inquiry. County lines is where drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are moved across the country - the 'county line' itself is a mobile phone number where orders are placed for the drugs. Vulnerable adults and children are often used to sell the drugs, with some people moved from their local area to another part of the country to sell drugs, often to pay off a debt. The Dundee raids were carried out as part of Operation Spignel, a joint operation with police in the West Midlands. Dundee-based Det Insp Alan Swanston from Police Scotland said: \"We've identified a serious organised crime group that are operating out of the West Midlands area and drug dealing in Dundee. \"Specialist officers will also develop and assess the intelligence and build a picture of what the group looks like and where they're located.\" Specialist resources are also being made available for the operation, including cybercrime officers. Det Insp Swanston said: \"The arrests will allow us to conduct interviews, examine any phones or devices that have been obtained and also be able to go through the addresses with a fine toothcomb to identify if there is evidence that would back up the intelligence.\"  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Consultation on a planned power line that would see a 31-mile pylon route built  from Wales to Shropshire has begun. The Vyrnwy Frankton Project, a scheme to build a new substation near Cefn Coch in Powys and connect it to the national network at Lower Frankton in Shropshire, includes underground cables and an overhead line. Six consultation events have been set up in village halls and community centres from 27 February to 8 March by Green Gen Cymru. People will be able to view a digital 3D model of the route, the company said. This is expected to be the final route-wide consultation before a planning application is submitted. North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan has called on the company to consider building the route underground and said communities would be affected visually and by noise. Senior project manager Sean Taylor said the company had considered areas important for tourism and recreation, adding: \"The route is planned to keep effects on these as low as we can, while balancing the effects on the landscape and the environment.\" Addressing effects on communities, he said: \"We have carefully considered views to and from villages in designing the connection. As much as possible, we've used woodland and the natural shape of the landscape to help reduce potential visual effects.\" Mr Taylor said the project was \"still open to influence\" and the firm was committed to working closely with communities and stakeholders. In Shropshire, consultation events are being held at West Felton Village Hall on 27 February, Hordley & Bagley Village Hall on 28 February and Llanymynech Village Hall on 1 March. Events will be held in Wales at Llanfair Caereinion Public Hall on 6 March, Llansantffraid Community Centre on 7 March and Meifod Village Hall Community Centre on 8 March. The consultation will close on 16 April. Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "The Channel Islands is set to be served by a fourth ferry firm after operator Islands Unlimited published its inter-island summer schedule.  It follows a decision by Jersey and Guernsey's governments to choose different ferry firms to operate their main sea links for the next 15 years, with French firm Manche Iles also offering a passenger ferry. Jersey's government opted for Danish firm DFDS, while Guernsey chose to stay with Condor - both have indicated they plan to operate limited services between the islands, but timetables have not yet been published.  Islands Unlimited managing director Chad Murray said: \"We are excited that we will be offering a daily inter-island foot passenger service this summer.\" Mr Murray said a standard adult return fare with his firm would be priced at about ¬£67.  The firm's schedule offers daily services between Guernsey and Jersey, running from 07:00 until 19:45 on weekdays (other than Tuesdays when it stops at 16:45). It will also run from 07:00 until 21:45 at weekends.  Mr Murray said the new summer schedule would be subject to \"some final discussions\" with Ports of Jersey.   The firm's boss said: \"We want to meet the needs of the islanders, as well as visitors.  \"Following stakeholder engagement, this offers the best fit for the communities, commuters, local business, sport and event, as well as offering great day trips for visitors to support tourism.\" Islands Unlimited has said its service could start in June. Chairman of the Guernsey Tourism Partnership, Ant Ford-Parker, said: \"We are delighted that this bold initiative is nearing completion.  \"The implications for tourism as well as the local communities are enormous.  \"We wish them every success.\" The BBC has approached the States of Guernsey and the Government of Jersey for comment.

         "Anti-Muslim hate at record level in UK, report says",
         "Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found.",
         "Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found. Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012. In its report the organisation said there had been a \"surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers\" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders. A government spokesperson called the findings \"extremely concerning\" and said it would \"seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs\". A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group. The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago. The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace. For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said. Tell Mama said that shift reflected \"the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities\". Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter. Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK. Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders. Tell Mama said that there had been a \"surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers\" since both the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and the 2024 riots sparked by the Southport murders. Iman Atta, the group's director, called for coordinated action by the government and said: \"As anti-Muslim hate continues to be felt by a greater number of British Muslims, both at a street and online level, our work and support for victims of anti-Muslim hate is needed now more than ever.\" The public must \"stand together against hatred and extremism\", she said, and urged those in positions of influence to \"consider how their language risks stereotyping communities and how it unduly influences discussions online and offline\". In response to the findings, the government said that \"attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society\". A spokesperson added: \"We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms.\" Hamas took 251 people hostage in the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. Around 59 hostages taken during 7 October attacks are still believed to be in Gaza. It was the last exchange of the Gaza ceasefire deal's first phase, leaving questions over what happens next. The delayed release of 600 Palestinian prisoners will reportedly go ahead when Hamas returns four Israeli hostages' bodies. Aid agencies say it is the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank in decades. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said.",
         "Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said. The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity. \"On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office,\" Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding \"no checks\" had been made. It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade. Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022. A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim. He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks. It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months. As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police.  The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with ¬£1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created. Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was \"better than nothing\", adding there needed to be more accountability for \"people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked\". \"All I can ever do is reflect on my brother's case, and on the day of my brother's murder, the murderer, he didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office, and the fact that he was under-age, so no checks were performed.\" She said: \"So I really do think that these, these measures can make a difference, and they will make a difference because it will make it harder.\" She described Ronan as the \"light of our life, the best brother anyone could ask for\". Since her son's death, Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, has campaigned for fundamental changes to the law to make it harder for people to sell and buy knives. \"The online sale of bladed articles played a crucial role in this tragedy. A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people. I knew we could not go on like this.\" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Kanda said she \"absolutely\" believed her son would not have died if the new legislation had been in place at the time of his death in 2022.  \"The murderers would not have been able to get the weapons they were able to get so easily. Nobody was able to stop them, and they were just 16,\" she said. On the new law she said: \"Out of tragedy comes a light. The light we all need.\" However, she stressed \"there's so much more we can do\" when tackling the root causes of knife crime. Introduced as part of the government's Crime and Policing Bill in the spring, the rules are in response to a review by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) into the online sale of knives. The changes will also see: Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said \"nothing is off the table\" in regards to knife crime as she described it as \"absolutely disgraceful\" that retailers were selling knives to under 18s. Speaking about Ronan's death on the Today programme she said: \"There was no check that day when the ninja sword, the 20-inch ninja sword was collected at the post office - nobody checked it.\" She paid tribute to his family, who she described as at the \"forefront\" of bringing the bill forward and said the new rules would acknowledge the \"problem\" of supply of weapons, rather than just possession, with \"proper sentencing\". The Home Office said the new measures would significantly tighten the law, which until now has been less stringent than the legislation covering the sale of alcohol, tobacco, fireworks or even scratch cards. \"It is horrifying how easy it is for young people to get hold of knives online,\" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. \"Even though children's lives are being lost, and families and communities are left devastated as a result.\" Commander Stephen Clayman, who led the NPCC review into online knife sales, said: \"Bizarrely it is harder to buy paracetamol in some respects than it is to buy a knife - that can't be right.  \"We want to make retailers more responsible for what they are selling.\" The recommendations also require social media companies to be more accountable for the \"thousands of knives\" that Cdr Clayman said were being sold on platforms. \"They are being quite clever about it in the way they don't overtly sell. But they show all the knives and encourage people to move to a different [online] platform to make the transaction. \"If they are selling knives and we can prove it, we will take legal action and ask for the content to be removed.\" The measures are aimed at stopping sellers like Stefan Petrescu from Southampton. He used Instagram to sell hundreds of knives. Police found receipts which revealed that Petrescu had bulk-bought more than ¬£3,000-worth of knives, which he had then sold online. Messages from Petrescu's seized phone showed the use of social media platforms to market the knives, with buyers saying they wanted  to \"shank\" (stab) or harm others. In one video, he wears a black balaclava-style mask and gloves while handling knives, advertising his stock of serrated machetes, knuckle dusters and other blades while drill music plays in the background - including the song \"Ready for War\". In October 2024, Petrescu was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to knife-related offences. The home secretary has said the government is on a \"mission\" to halve knife crime over the next 10 years. There were 262 murders involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to March 2024, according to the Ben Kinsella Trust. Fifty-seven of those killed were under 25.

         "Senior doctors responsible for monitoring cancer care in England and Wales are concerned failings in NHS services are contributing to up to half of patients not getting the right treatment for some cancers. In evidence provided to the BBC, the National Cancer Audit Collaborating Centre (NatCan) highlighted particular problems with prostate, kidney and colon cancers. The expert group said it had found significant variation between hospitals and warned the problems accessing nationally-recommended treatments were putting lives at risk. It carries out audits across nine major cancers - responsible for 80% of cases - and has found shortfalls across a range of different cancer types and stages. Figures shared with the BBC show: NatCan said while a minority of patients would be choosing not to have treatment themselves and others may not be well enough, that could not fully explain the scale of the shortfall or variation between hospitals. Governments in both nations say improving services is a key priority and England is in the process of drawing up a new cancer strategy, which ministers say will revolutionise services. Ian Pattison's case highlights the value of getting the right treatment. He was diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer in 2020, at the age of 65. It had started spreading to nearby organs and he was offered the nationally-recommended treatment of hormone therapy and radiotherapy for his particular type of cancer. He said the treatment was brutal but, now aged 70, his cancer is in remission and he  is enjoying life. Mr Pattison, from Durham, said: \"I was lucky that I live close to a specialist cancer centre in Newcastle where I could get the best treatment. \"It was hard going through it all and coping with the side effects but I am so thankful I got the treatment. \"I feel fit and well. I love walking, spending time with my family and looking after the grandchildren.\" But Prof Ajay Aggarwal, clinical director at NatCan, which is run by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) for NHS England and the Welsh government, said it was concerning so many patients were not getting the recommended treatment, adding that the variation was hard to understand. \"We need to do better,\" he said. \"With cancer, we often hear people talking about what the next breakthrough is but, the fact remains, using what we have better could make a huge difference. It would extend and save lives.\" Prof Aggarwal said there were likely to be several reasons for the problems and variation, including some services unfairly assuming older patients could not cope with treatment, as well as problems with staffing and capacity. He said there was evidence of smaller hospitals not always referring patients on to specialist centres where they can get treatment but added that even some of the big centres were coming up short for some cancers. But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better. RCS president Tim Mitchell echoed the concerns, saying: \"The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out.  \"At worst, this may mean some patients are needlessly dying or in unnecessary pain.\"   And cancer charities said tacking the failings was arguably more important than reducing waiting times. Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said the findings were \"quite staggering\", adding that tackling the variation should be the \"number one priority\" in the forthcoming national cancer strategy. \"Getting the best care to give you the greatest chance of survival should not come down to which hospital you attend or where you live in the country,\" she said. Ms Byrne said patients should get the right care for their particular type of cancer, no matter where they are.  \"We are concerned that people from deprived, rural or ethnically diverse communities could be losing out in particular,\" she said. Amy Rylance, from Prostate Cancer UK, said patients were effectively being denied their \"best chance of a cure\", adding: \"This needs to change now.\" NHS England cancer director Prof Peter Johnson said: \"We know that patients' experience of cancer treatment does vary ‚Äì and we are working hard to address this.\" And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Patients should be able to access the cancer care they need regardless of where they live and we are committed to addressing health inequalities as we rebuild the NHS.\" A new cancer strategy is expected to be published in the second half of the year, which Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said will revolutionise services. A Welsh government spokeswoman said it was working with the NHS to \"plan, deliver, recover and improve cancer services\". She said the audit highlighted areas where further work was needed.

         "The most senior judge in England and Wales has said she was \"deeply troubled\" by comments made by Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch over a judge's ruling in an immigration case.",
         "The most senior judge in England and Wales has said she was \"deeply troubled\" by comments made by Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch over a judge's ruling in an immigration case. Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was \"completely wrong\". Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration\". But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were \"unacceptable\" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges. A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had \"made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy.\" Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an \"all-time high\" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work. The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week.  Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood. Badenoch said: \"A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do.  \"This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?\" The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them.  Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws. The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity. Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes.  This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives. Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: \"Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. \"She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework.\" He went on: \"It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.\" The prime minister has not specified what the \"legal loophole\" is that he wants to close.  Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case.  They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open \"floodgates\". The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians. Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that \"both the question and the answer were unacceptable\". \"It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,\" she said. \"Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process.\" She also said MPs, \"just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law\". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices. Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said \"politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament\" - and that such debate \"doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary\". \"This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,\" she said in a statement on X. A government spokesperson said: \"Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing\".  \"As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,\" the statement added.  Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was \"not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs\". \"Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,\" she told reporters. \"If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate.\" \"It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,\" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are \"public servants acting independently\" and that, \"frankly, judges deserve better\".

         "Ferry tickets between Guernsey and Jersey will go on sale on Wednesday after discussions between both islands' governments and three ferry companies. Guernsey's ferry provider Brittany Ferries will offer inter-island sailings on Wednesdays from the beginning of April. DFDS, which operates Jersey's main routes, plans to operate its own weekly service and is expected to put them on sale at a later date, the States of Guernsey said. Deputy Neil Inder, president of Economic Development, said there was \"significant demand\" for the services from the islands' tourism, sports and cultural sectors, which explained the \"real frustration\" about delays putting tickets on sale. Both governments are in talks with Manche-Iles Express to operate additional passenger ferries, he said. Inder said it was \"very encouraging\" bookings by French passengers coming to Guernsey were up 77% compared to last year. Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook. Follow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

         "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever.",
         "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever. Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. \"'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'\" said Meghan's post. The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be \"beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday\". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it \"limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area\". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title. If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at ¬£7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at ¬£6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. \"Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,\" said Meghan. \"But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it.\" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has \"poured my heart into\" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as \"whatever\".

         "Police investigating the disappearance of a man more than 20 years ago are searching an address he visited on the night he vanished. Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer, Scotland, a few months earlier.  A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries. The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, had been found alternative accommodation, the force said. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were \"still in limbo\" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said he was determined to provide the family \"with the answers they deserve\". \"After a review of the information we have, we are refocusing our efforts in the Coronation Street area and an address we know he visited on the night he went missing. \"We are grateful to the current occupant of that premises for their cooperation, and that of the wider community as we conduct our enquiries. \"We are also asking anyone who lived in Coronation Street at the time to get in touch as they may have relevant information without even realising.\" Follow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

         "'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review",
         "Successive governments trying to look \"tough on crime\" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests.",
         "Successive governments trying to look \"tough on crime\" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests. The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending. The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were \"knee-jerk\" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action.  Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026. \"It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,\" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme.  England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report.  Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high. The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding.  It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring. The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built. Mr Gauke said: \"Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse. \"For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system.\" He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, \"prison is not the only form of punishment\". Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population. In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes. As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place. Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people. \"Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,\" it reads.  Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen \"something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most\".  \"As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,\" he added.  \"We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive.\" The first of up to 390 prisoners are being freed early in an attempt to ease overcrowding in jails. The replacement HMP Glasgow will open in 2028, three years later than originally planned. The closure of the jail is costing the Devon economy millions of pounds, business leaders say.

         "The Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have revealed their artistic skills in four portraits of each other. It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis. The royals drew the portraits as \"a moment of connection\" to \"spend time looking at and focusing on one another\" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added. The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us. The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions. The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis. Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university. Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day. These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account. A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte. The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte. The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings. The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills. \"These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us,\" said the message on social media, alongside the pictures. \"Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative,\" the post continued.

National Lottery operator Allwyn said the lucky ticket-holder came forward over the weekend to claim their prize of ¬£65,341,620.50. The operator added that Saturday's ¬£7.4 million Lotto jackpot had also been claimed by a single ticket-holder. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: \"It's been an astonishing weekend of millionaire-making, which promises to keep me and my team very busy.\" The EuroMillions winner matched all seven numbers on Friday's draw - 04, 14, 31, 36 and 38 with Lucky Stars 03 and 10. Fourteen UK players also netted ¬£1 million each in Friday evening's EuroMillions UK  Millionaire Maker draw. Mr Carter said on Monday that seven of those winners are still yet to claim their prize. \"We're asking everyone to check their tickets and we're very much looking forward to meeting all the lucky winners soon,\" he added. Friday's ticket-holder is the second UK EuroMillions jackpot winner of 2025. Earlier this month, one anonymous ticket-holder scooped a prize of more than ¬£83.4m after it was left unclaimed for 13 days. Winners must claim their prize within 180 days of the draw. Successful players can decide whether they want to be named or remain anonymous upon claiming the prize. The UK's biggest EuroMillions jackpot, worth ¬£195m, was claimed by an unnamed winner in July 2022. That same year, a then record-breaking ¬£184m was won by Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester, with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May.

         "A key union has joined faith leaders and charities in warning that a policy banning refugees arriving on small boats from gaining UK citizenship could \"breed division and distrust\". Fresh guidance states anyone entering the UK illegally having made the dangerous English Channel crossing - on a small boat or hiding in a vehicle, for example - will be refused citizenship. Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, and nine Church of England bishops are among 147 signatories of a letter, seen by the BBC, to the home secretary urging her to rethink the policy. They wrote that the government must instead focus on ensuring refugees \"are welcomed and integrated into British life\". The Home Office says the government has merely strengthened rules that were already in place on who could obtain citizenship. The letter argues that citizenship is \"not just a legal status\" but \"a tangible fulfilment of the promise of safety, dignity, and opportunity\".  \"When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come.\" Referring to a riot at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham last August, it says that part of the response to that violence \"should be on creating integrated communities\". It went on: \"Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust. \"It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits 'us vs them' and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets.\" As well as Ms McAnea of Unison - Labour's most generous union backer in the 2024 general election campaign, donating ¬£1.49m - other signatories include the bishops of Chelmsford, Leicester, Gloucester and Dover.  The chief executives of the Refugee Council and Refugee Action have also signed it, alongside Islamic Relief UK and other faith leaders, including rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors.  The government's new policy means anyone applying for citizenship from 10 February, having previously entered the UK illegally will be refused regardless of how long ago they arrived. Previously, refugees who arrived via irregular routes would have to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship.  It has also been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy. A Home Office spokesperson said: \"There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. \"The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.\" The number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has led the government to promise action. Councillor Dave Geddis says the concern comes from a \"lack of communication\". Unison warns plans to close three day centres could cost West Berkshire Council more in the long-term. Refugees are told to pack up tents from Manchester city centre after the council took legal action. Go Back To Where You Came From saw six Brits follow routes taken by refugees to reach the UK.

         "A teenager has been charged after disorder broke out in Cardiff city centre ahead of Saturday's football match against Bristol City.  Mounted police and public order-trained officers were called to an incident near the junction of St Mary Street and Wood Street. South Wales Police said one male had been arrested but later confirmed no further arrests were made.  A 18-year-old from South Gloucestershire has been charged with a Section 4 Public Order offence and has been bailed, the force confirmed.  South Wales Police previously said derby fixtures like Saturday's match came with a \"highly charged atmosphere\". A policing operation was put in place to ensure both sets of supporters left Cardiff City Stadium on Leckwith Road safely following the Championship match which ended in a 1-1 draw. Netflix's Havoc, written and directed by Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans, was shot across south Wales. BBC reporter Matthew Bassett was left stranded in 2014, and finds his story is far from unique. Film locations take a starring role in a tourism campaign, while a film agency promotes Welsh talent. The Welsh government says it will ban greyhound racing in what would be a first for the UK. Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt says he is not interested in taking on the permanent job after overseeing an outstanding display in the 27-18 defeat against Ireland.  Copyright 2025 BBC.
