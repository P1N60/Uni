       "['Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.  Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded. This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.   The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on \"a foreign army\"  that he said was operating in the east. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23. He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.  \"There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.  It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu\\'s main square. In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects. \"This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,\" he said.  The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.  The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year\\'s internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the L√©on Th√©venin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I\\'m a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L√©on Th√©venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren\\'t in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it\\'s accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L√©on Th√©venin\\'s deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year. Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor\\'s widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was \"proud\" of her husband\\'s impact at the BBC, and also said her family were \"thankful to the BBC for remembering him\" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent.

       " '\"I swear to God I need help,\" said the man quietly on the other end of the line. The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country\\'s border with Thailand. They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.  The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people ‚Äì more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough. The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten. He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could. Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills. Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses. \"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\" Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.  Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money. China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border. Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October. He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss. \"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\" Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.  He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife\\'s jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls. The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.  It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business. That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds. The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.  Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border. Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.  A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled. The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.  The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses. Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people. Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business. \"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it ‚Äì we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers. \"Unfortunately, it seems we\\'re in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres. \"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we\\'re not engaging fast enough.\" Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them. But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them. Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.  On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital. \"I just want to go home,\" he said over the phone. \"I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.\" The move comes after rights groups warned the Uyghurs face torture and possibly death back in China. \"I don\\'t know how to put it into words,\" says one of the hostages released from Gaza last month.

       " \"At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.  The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.  The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.  The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.  Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.  The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year\\'s internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the L√©on Th√©venin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I\\'m a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L√©on Th√©venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren\\'t in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it\\'s accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L√©on Th√©venin\\'s deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'King Mohammed VI has asked Moroccans to abstain from performing the Muslim rite of slaughtering sheep during Eid al-Adha this year due to a sharp drop in the country\\'s herd.   The shortages are blamed on seven years of drought. Eid al-Adha, which falls in June, commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim, or Abraham, to sacrifice his son on God\\'s command.  Muslims mark the event by slaughtering sheep or other animals and the meat is shared among family and donated to the poor.  But herds in Morocco have shrunk by 38% in a decade due to dry pastures, according to official data. Meat prices are rocketing, and 100,000 sheep are being imported from Australia. Performing the rite \"under these difficult circumstances will cause significant harm to large segments of our people, especially those with limited income,\" King Mohammed VI said in a speech read by the minister of religious affairs on national television on Wednesday. His father, Hassan II, made the same appeal back in 1966 when Morocco also suffered a long drought. Explaining the challenge in a recent interview, Morocco\\'s agriculture minister, Ahmed Bouari, said \"the need to secure water for priority sectors, such as driving and industry\" meant that agriculture was  the worst-hit, \"with most irrigation areas subject to strict regulations and water rationing\". Import tax and VAT on cattle, sheep, camels and red meat were recently lifted to help stabilise prices across Morocco.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school. The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\" He said that he was satisfied that the parents\\' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy\\'s parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\". The boy\\'s father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana. He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\". The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. \"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote. He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I\\'m begging to go back to my old school.\" However the High Court heard that the boy\\'s parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent\\'s worst nightmare\", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son\\'s \"destruction\". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy\\'s father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children\\'s charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.  The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn\\'t the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\" They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager. \"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\" The boy\\'s barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\" The boy\\'s father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy\\'s solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. \"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents\\' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\". Following the judgment, he added: \"We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.\"  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets in Bukavu, a city recently captured by the rebels.

       " 'Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. \"He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me.\" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. \"I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,\" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men\\'s block right next door called \"Safina\", she says.  \"We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped.\" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.  Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.  By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that \"at least 153 women had perished\", quoting \"reliable sources in the prison\". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women\\'s section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. \"At one point I didn\\'t know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.  \"When I sleep at night, everything I\\'ve seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.\"  Nadine says she was also raped by two men.  \"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.   \"I don\\'t think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children\\'s clothing.  Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women\\'s section. \"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says. \"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.  Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.  However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. \"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women\\'s prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"  Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.  \"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\" Some of the prisoners who broke into the women\\'s section were looking for a safer escape route, she says. They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.  Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body. \"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn\\'t count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC. She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.  \"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\" The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one. Florence says the women\\'s prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help. \"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says. By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling. The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison. In a tent in the grounds of Goma\\'s hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend. She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine. But her agony is more than physical. Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison. \"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don\\'t know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.  She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother\\'s side. How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter? She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence. The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out. Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison. \"No-one will follow [this case],\" Sifa says. \"No-one will be pursued. It\\'s already over.\" Additional reporting from the BBC\\'s Wietske Burema, G√∂ktay Koraltan and Yvonne Katinga. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Nigeria\\'s former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993. A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend. Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time. Here are four takeaways from the book: This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria\\'s history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections. In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election. The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil.  The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated. Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote. However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis.  \"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes. At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country‚Äôs judiciary as reasons for the annulment. Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later. Nigeria\\'s current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place. Abiola‚Äôs son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members. \"Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,‚Äù he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast. Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections. General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida\\'s presidency. \"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls. \"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\" However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers.  \"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\" Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness. \"I had to choose between saving a friend\\'s life and the nation\\'s future,\" he writes. Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria\\'s first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders. The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects. He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny. The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover. The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president. Babangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters. \"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only \\'Igbo\\' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today\\'s Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as \\'Hausa\\' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\" The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war.  Many Nigerians see Babangida\\'s wife Maryam as the country\\'s most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried. \"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes. \"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds. \"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah\\'s hands, not in humanity\\'s. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says. He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.

       " 'The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan\\'s civil war, the BBC has learned. Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump\\'s executive order halting contributions from the US government\\'s development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut. It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected. The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023. The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods. \"People are knocking on the volunteers\\' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\" The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID. The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice. The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes. The closure of the majority of Sudan\\'s emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world\\'s largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations. The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country\\'s civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID. It is a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms. The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN. Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works. \"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria.\" For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out. There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege. Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\". Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy\\'s Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID. \"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it\\'s never going to be what it was.\" \"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation. They are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\". The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful. \"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances. In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN\\'s Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan. Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington\\'s policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries. \"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP\\'s assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month. The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further. \"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees\\' regional bureau director. He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It\\'s extremely difficult.\" They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who\\'ve come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh. Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority. \"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said. Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people. They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing. Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape. Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan\\'s agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods. They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight. With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders. Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained.  The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\". It does not help that the agency was already underfunded.  The UNHCR\\'s call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive. The US has been the UNHCR\\'s main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo.  \"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC. Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", he says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant. Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood. \"I feel liberated,\" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own. The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman\\'s fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as \"getting your tubes tied\". Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya\\'s health ministry. It is unclear how many of these women didn\\'t already have children.  Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing. \"Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,\" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC. \"But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure.\" Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult. \"Doctors don\\'t typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,\" said Dr Bosire. Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children. She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading. Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation. \"I interacted with women\\'s life stories that didn\\'t feature children at all,\" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence. \"It made me realise that a life like this was possible.\" She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off. It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (¬£190; $230) at a private hospital. Ms Sironka felt that women\\'s rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision. It made her fear that a woman\\'s right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could. \"Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,\" she argued. When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life. And as for dating and relationships? \"I\\'m still thinking about it,\" she said with a shrug. And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood. Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation. Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster. She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure. \"I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,\" she told the BBC. Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation. \"I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,\" she said. Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau\\'s decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms. After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution. When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance. She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God. \"He asked me, \\'What if I meet someone who wants kids?\\'\" she said. The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an \"imaginary person\" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said. Ms Gitau said the dismissal was \"heart breaking\". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted. Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient\\'s right to make decisions about their health. \"This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn\\'t normal for women to want a tubal ligation,\" she said. Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles. \"It remains inconclusive,\" he told the BBC. But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services. She was armed with a bullet-point list of reasons to support her decision and was relieved to find there there was no pushback: \"The doctor was very kind.\" Currently single, she is living happily with her decision, which she feels gives her control over her own life. The 34-year-old is also happy with the reaction to her video - and relieved that there has been no major backlash. She says most people online have been cheering her on, which has seen her confidence grow. \"Women can contribute to the world in so many other ways,\" she said. \"It does not have to be through raising a whole human being. I am grateful to live in a generation where choice is a thing.\"  Additional reporting by the BBC\\'s Susan Gachuchi. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Legend has it Bernard Shabangu\\'s grandfather, Bhobho, once speared down a lion that was terrorising his community in Mpumalanga, a province in eastern South Africa. The story goes that the lion was so fearsome that even the white people who had guns would run away when it roared. \"One day, my grandfather is said to have walked up the hill where the lion was roaring with his spear and shield,\" says Bernard. \"The lion charged at him, but my grandfather speared him to death and was made Headman for his bravery.\" As a Headman, or traditional leader, Bhobho owned cattle and land. Then one day in the mid-1950s, it was all taken away from him with no compensation under a law introduced in 1950 called the Group Areas Act. This stated that South Africa\\'s apartheid government could choose certain areas to be used by a single race. In the early 1990s, democratic South Africa\\'s new constitution allowed for land taken from black farmers to be returned to them. But it did so with great care and the setting-up of new cross-community partnerships were encouraged. In this spirit, when Bernard, now 48, and his community decided to reclaim their land, they agreed to work in partnership with the white farmers who had been working on it. \"We did not say we want the white folks to leave,\" says Bernard. \"They are here, they are working with us, they are supporting us‚Ä¶ we are saying that partnership is what\\'s going to take this country forward.\" Today, the Matsamo Communal Property Association and its partners employ over 2,000 people from the local community and is the country\\'s biggest exporter of lychee to the US. It also grows papayas, sugar cane and bananas for local supermarkets. Matsamo has been hailed as an example of what successful land reform can look like in South Africa. But for some in the country, progress on land reform has been too slow. In January, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law a bill that allows, in some circumstances, land to be seized by the state without compensation. Opponents argue it is a threat to the principle of private ownership. And among those opponents is Donald Trump. He has said the new bill was \"hateful rhetoric\" towards \"racially disfavored landowners.\" Mr Trump said he would pause all aid to South Africa, which could be worth around $320m (¬£253m) according to the US Agency for International Development. Some worry he might eventually exclude South Africa from a trade agreement, estimated by the office of the US trade representative to be worth  $14.7bn (¬£11.6bn) a year. The challenge facing Rampahosa is a knotty one: can he find a way to speed up land reform to appease his political friends and foes, without losing one of the country\\'s biggest trading partners? Three and a half hours\\' drive west of the Matsamo CPA, near the town of Ermelo, is the farm of Lion du Plessis. He is an Afrikaner farmer, a descendant of Huguenots who once fled France. He works and lives on the farm his grandfather acquired in the 1970s. He grows maize and soybeans, as well as rearing sheep and cattle. His farm is spread across a thousand lush and green hectares with a serene lake in the middle of it. \"I was born on this farm, I grew up here and I\\'ve been farming since 2012,\" he tells me in the middle of one of his fields. For Lion, the new expropriation act threatens property rights and is a risk for farmers. \"Expropriation is not a problem if there\\'s compensation, but the compensation must be just and fair and equitable.\" He argues that without private property rights, farms such as his won\\'t be able to borrow money. \"If you put a tool like this in the government\\'s hands, where they can just take land, or take any property for that matter, it is not economically viable to invest in South Africa. \"In agriculture we need private property in order to access capital, we need to borrow money from the banks or from agricultural corporations to cover our costs. And if we don\\'t have private property rights, we won\\'t be able to get money and to get capital.\" The impact the bill could have on foreign investment is also of concern to AfriForum, a group that seeks to protect the rights of Afrikaners. \"We know that international investors, if they hear the term \"no compensation\", and you give that power to many state organisations, what they call an expropriation authority, then it will deter investment,\" its CEO Kallie Kriel tells me. But for Bernard these laws are a careful attempt to address long-standing unfairness. He insists: \"Land reform in South Africa is not going to be a vulgar land grab. What the president is proposing is a constitutionally-managed process of land reform for the public good, to say black and white people in South Africa must share in the land that is there.\" Professor Ruth Hall from the Institute for Poverty, Land, and Agrarian Studies of the University of the Western Cape argues the issue of access to land in South Africa dates back to before the start of formal apartheid in 1948. \"If we think about the history of South Africa, this is what we can call a settler colony. It was a colony in which large numbers of European settlers, over many centuries, came and settled, displacing indigenous people,\" she says. By the end of the 19th Century, most of the land that is currently South Africa had been taken over by white people. The Natives\\' Land Act of 1913 defined less than one-tenth of South Africa as Black \"reserves\" and prohibited any purchase or lease of land by Blacks outside the reserves. She says the subsequent Group Areas Act only reinforced the division and further reduced economic opportunities for black people. Prof Hall calls it \"structural apartheid geography\" and explains that this is \"very much intact,\" today. She describes how even though there is a growing black middle class in South Africa, there are still fundamental problems for the majority of black South Africans \"who either do not have access to well located land in the cities or who live in rural areas without secure rights.\" Agriculture remains one of the main sources of economic revenue for the country, but the majority of commercial agricultural land is still in the hands of the white minority which makes up around 7% of the population. There is an ongoing debate as to whether the no-compensation clause breaches section 25 of the constitution, which establishes property rights for all South Africans. Kallie Kriel thinks the bill is rife for abuse. He says: \"Actually, any reason can be used by the expropriating authority, which can be a corrupt or radical municipality.\" But land lawyer Bulelwa Mabasa, who was on a panel that advised President Cyril Ramaphosa on land reform, thinks that there are \"sufficient safeguards\" and says it\\'s clear when expropriation can take place: \"There is a very heavy burden that is placed on the expropriation authority to have reports from different departments, justifying the need for the expropriation in the first place, and justifying the need for expropriation without compensation.\" In 1996, the South African government launched its land reform programme, promising to settle all claims for redistribution by 2005 and to redistribute 30% of white-owned commercial agricultural land to black South Africans by 2014. The fact neither target has been met helps explain the pressure for last month\\'s toughened-up legislation. Prof Hall explains: \"There\\'s a mandate on the state that it must actually redistribute land. It must deal with historical claims to land.\" AfriForum has conceded that no large-scale land seizures have taken place and that the majority of land still remains in the hands of the white minority. But balancing the obligation to redistribute with property rights was never going to be straightforward. And now the debate around land ownership has gone beyond the borders of South Africa due to the recent intervention of US president Donald Trump, who issued an executive order on 7 February, just two and a half weeks after being sworn into office. The order claimed the expropriation act would \"enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners\\' agricultural property without compensation\". The executive order claimed the act was part of a number of discriminatory policies and \"hateful rhetoric\" towards \"racially disfavored landowners\". The American President also accused Pretoria of taking aggressive positions towards the United States and its allies, including accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), and strengthening its ties with Iran. As a result of these actions, Trump said he would pause all aid to South Africa and offered to resettle all \"Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination\". South Africa\\'s case against Israel is seen by some as evidence it supports Hamas, in addition to the close ties it maintains with Iran. \"South Africa is trying to maintain its alliance with North America and Europe, while at the same time building its relationship with its partners in the global South,\" says Prof Hall. \"In my view, South Africa\\'s attempt to play both sides in an increasingly polarised world is what is really at play here.\" Trump is not the only figure in his administration to have taken an interest in South Africa\\'s internal affairs. So too has Elon Musk, who\\'s been tasked with managing government efficiency in the US. Musk, who was born in Pretoria, has been trying to license his Starlink telecommunications business in South Africa. But under the country\\'s Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy telecom firms are required to have 30% ownership by black people. Musk called BEE \"racist\". Currently, only 3% of the country\\'s top companies are controlled by black South Africans. Every year, the US president reviews which African countries should continue to be part of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). It allows some African countries to export goods to the US duty free and is credited with creating thousands of jobs across the continent, including in South Africa. But now there are fears Donald Trump\\'s promise to cut all \"future funding to South Africa\" may see South Africa excluded. Doing so may, however, be a bit of a blunt tool - Prof Hall points out that coming out of AGOA would ironically disproportionately affect the white farmers Donald Trump says he wants to protect. \"I can assure you that most white farmers are far more worried about this punitive act on our trade deal with the US than they are about land expropriation,\" she said. So can the South African government, and President Cyril Ramaphosa\\'s ANC specifically, satisfy those who believe further land reform is a must without being frozen out economically by the US and losing foreign investors? One job is to work out what is really driving Donald Trump. Nomvula Mokonyane, Deputy Secretary General of the ANC, does not believe this is solely about the issue of land and thinks South Africa\\'s position over Israel may well be the driver. She says: \"Our view is that we need to let our government engage the American administration, so that then we understand whether are we dealing with the issue of the expropriation of land, or are we dealing with many other issues‚Ä¶ related to Palestine and so on and so forth.\" The signing of the expropriation bill comes in the context of the ANC finding itself in a coalition with other parties for the first time, and it may be trying to signal to black voters that it\\'s still willing to fight for their rights. After Mr Trump\\'s funding freeze, Mr Ramaphosa said South Africa will not be bullied in his state of the nation address earlier this month. It\\'s one of the few positions that all his coalition partners appear to agree with. Prof Hall does not detect much possibility of any kind of u-turn on the new law. She says: \"We have said very clearly the Expropriation Act is a law that was passed by a democratic parliament. He has signed it into law, which is his obligation as state president.\" South Africa is already feeling the effects of US\\' diplomatic pressure: both the US secretary of state and the treasury secretary have refused to join their counterparts at this month\\'s G20 meetings hosted by South Africa. And there are concerns Donald Trump could also be absent from the leaders\\' summit later this year. President Ramaphosa has promised to send envoys to the US and other countries to explain his country\\'s positions on the expropriation act, the war in the Middle East, as well as some of its other foreign policy decisions. Whether South Africa can soften the current hostility coming from Washington, without compromising on its national priorities is a huge test for this fledgling democracy.

       " 'The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region\\'s two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted.  Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese. For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians.  Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo\\'s vast mineral wealth.  It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name. That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province. This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians. At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo. The perception that Congolese Tutsis are \"foreign\" can have deadly consequences.  Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu\\'s Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities. He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle\\'s son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC\\'s request for comment on this allegation. Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he \"wished the world knew\" his community was experiencing what he called a \"silent genocide\". Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu. \"I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (¬£120) to save myself from being imprisoned,\" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23\\'s cause. Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa.  Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority. Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo. As DR Congo\\'s Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities \"alternately empowered and the undermined\" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn\\'t Say Its Name. In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960. But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were \"derived of their nationality and left stateless\", a UN report noted.  In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996. It also states that \"many\" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats. Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community. But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites \"hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence\", the experts said. There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 \"in an apparent case of ethnic hatred\". Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment.  Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns. He told the BBC he had seen \"pretty terrifying\" social media posts over the past few weeks - \"a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they\\'re Rwandan\". Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23\\'s current uprising, Mr Stearns says \"many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels\". The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President F√©lix Tshisekedi said he had \"had enough\" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo. However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: \"We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community\". Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he \"strongly\" believed his ethnic group was discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she \"looked like a Rwandan spy\". This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries.  \"The Banyamulenge have been here since Congo was Congo!\" he said, exasperated.

       " 'An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D\\'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it\\'s banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available.  The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo\\'s factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo\\'s directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa.  In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn\\'t flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city\\'s chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets.  \"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale\\'s poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It\\'s not just in Tamale that Aveo\\'s pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo\\'s pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D\\'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high.  Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria\\'s National Bureau of Statistics.  The Chairman of Nigeria\\'s Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it\\'s in every community in Nigeria\". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol.  The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol.  West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC\\'s undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".  People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo\\'s new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep.  \"It could be deep enough that people don\\'t breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It\\'s a fairly painful experience.\" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana\\'s national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond.   The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India\\'s efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa.  These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India\\'s fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry\\'s exports are worth at least $28bn (¬£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC\\'s undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face‚Ä¶ with one of the men at the root of Africa\\'s opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn\\'t seem to care‚Ä¶ describing it simply as business.\" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo\\'s Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized.  \"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they\\'ll burn your drugs\". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery. The two sides discussed ways to further strengthen the Indo-EU strategic partnership. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The arrival of 200 Indian nurses in Wales is welcomed - but a union warns of far greater shortages. The incident happened during a public event where the K-pop star hugged 1,000 fans. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

       " 'Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised. In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it. More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone. The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around. They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger. For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times. The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000. A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter\\'s grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15. Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter\\'s cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother\\'s grave was stolen. In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter\\'s cross. \"This is my child\\'s grave - my fourth child,\" she said pointing towards the concrete cross. The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal. \"The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on,\" Ms Chumbi tells the BBC. \"There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles.\" Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home. Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi\\'s brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community. \"This is too bad‚Ä¶ when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot,\" he tells the BBC. The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites. The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; ¬£0.22-¬£0.28) per kilogramme.  It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol. \"Metal dealers often buy without asking questions,\" says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market. Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants. The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law. Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities. \"In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison,\" Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC. He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase. Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods. \"If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police.\" Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers. Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro\\'s health officer, said the city\\'s authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that \"this requires resources and time.  \"It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow.\" He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components. Tanzania\\'s government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry. Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations. \"What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe,\" he told the BBC. Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out. Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places. \"Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track,\" he says. For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration. Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest.

       " 'Gunfire and explosions have ripped through a rally held by rebel leaders in a city they recently captured in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic.  Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded. This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.   The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi\\'s government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on \"a foreign army\"  that he said was operating in the east. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23. He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city.  \"There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.  It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu\\'s main square. In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects. \"This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,\" he said.  The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region.  The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'The BBC is seeking a rising star of African journalism for the BBC News Komla Dumor Award, which is now in its 10th year. Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor\\'s widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was \"proud\" of her husband\\'s impact at the BBC, and also said her family were \"thankful to the BBC for remembering him\" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent. As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC\\'s global audiences. Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world. The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences. Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year\\'s winner. During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith. Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: \"We are proud to launch this year\\'s BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient.  \"Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor\\'s powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity.  \"Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year\\'s winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply.\" Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC\\'s first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service. He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News\\' European morning segment. He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award. Between 2007 and 2009 he hosted Network Africa on BBC World Service, before joining The World Today programme. In 2009 Dumor became the first host of the African business news programme on BBC World News, Africa Business Report. He travelled across Africa, meeting Africa\\'s top entrepreneurs and reporting on the latest business trends around the continent. In 2013 Dumor featured in New African magazine\\'s list of the 100 most influential Africans. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year\\'s internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the L√©on Th√©venin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years \"Because of me, countries stay connected,\" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. \"IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,\" he says. \"You have heroes that save lives - I\\'m a hero because I save communication.\" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the L√©on Th√©venin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. \"As long as the servers aren\\'t in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it\\'s accessing Facebook or any other online service,\" says Benjamin Smith, the L√©on Th√©venin\\'s deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. \"The cable generally doesn\\'t break on its own unless you\\'re in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,\" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship\\'s remotely operated vehicle (ROV). \"But most of the time it\\'s people anchoring where they shouldn\\'t and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.\" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. \"In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,\" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the L√©on Th√©venin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship\\'s anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. \"There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there\\'s a problem,\" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship\\'s chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable\\'s insulation - known as a \"shunt fault\" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. \"It doesn\\'t sink,\" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV\\'s three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the L√©on Th√©venin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship\\'s location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. \"Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,\" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. \"It\\'s part of the job,\" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship\\'s chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. \"I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,\" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son\\'s wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. \"I\\'ve heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn\\'t have a mum,\" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. \"But I\\'m retiring in six months,\" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship\\'s mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father\\'s footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. \"I was involved in gangs when I was younger,\" Mr Smith says, \"My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.\" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. \"We are the link between Africa and the world,\" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

       " 'The UK\\'s decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is \"punitive\", authorities in the East African country have said. In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda\\'s support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo\\'s government says. The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was \"critical\" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, \"excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable\". Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about ¬£32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year. Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending \"future defence training assistance\", the statement said. These measures will last until \"significant progress\" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda\\'s foreign ministry said the \"punitive measures\" announced by the UK government \"in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable\". \"The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC.\" The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda. The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK\\'s government. DR Congo\\'s government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda. Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda\\'s Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe.  The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda\\'s support for M23. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23\\'s spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said. Responding to the US move, Rwanda\\'s foreign ministry said the sanctions were \"unjustified\". The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state. The rebels have captured eastern DR Congo\\'s two biggest cities, Goma and Bukavu.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " \"At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.  The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.  The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.  The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.  Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.  The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. \"He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me.\" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. \"I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,\" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men\\'s block right next door called \"Safina\", she says.  \"We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped.\" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region.  Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape.  By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that \"at least 153 women had perished\", quoting \"reliable sources in the prison\". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women\\'s section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. \"At one point I didn\\'t know what was happening any more,\" she says. \"It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved.\" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it.  \"When I sleep at night, everything I\\'ve seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.\"  Nadine says she was also raped by two men.  \"They came with alcohol,\" she tells the BBC. \"They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here.\" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out.   \"I don\\'t think that justice can exist in Congo,\" she says. \"I condemn the way the government is running things.\" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children\\'s clothing.  Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them.  Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says \"children started to die\" when tear gas was fired into the women\\'s section. \"The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,\" Florence says. \"When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,\" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else.  Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces.  However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. \"You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women\\'s prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform.\"  Florence says she heard \"bullets crackling\" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside.  \"If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation.\" Some of the prisoners who broke into the women\\'s section were looking for a safer escape route, she says. They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed.  But soon that gap was filled - by the fire.  Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body. \"People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn\\'t count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,\" Florence tells the BBC. She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives.  \"The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out.\" The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one. Florence says the women\\'s prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors.  They were offered no help. \"Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,\" she says. By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling. The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison. In a tent in the grounds of Goma\\'s hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend. She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine. But her agony is more than physical. Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison. \"I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don\\'t know what. She died on the spot,\" Sifa tells the BBC.  She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was \"without sin\". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother\\'s side. How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter? She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence. The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out. Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison. \"No-one will follow [this case],\" Sifa says. \"No-one will be pursued. It\\'s already over.\" Additional reporting from the BBC\\'s Wietske Burema, G√∂ktay Koraltan and Yvonne Katinga. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

       " 'One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu\\'s 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government. In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president\\'s decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country\\'s farmers. In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu\\'s election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister. The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu\\'s most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament. \"You don\\'t address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture,\" said El-Rufai. \"Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries,\" he said. \"I have issues with many of them [Tinubu\\'s policies], and I\\'m in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately.\" The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made. El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party. \"As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party\\'s candidate,‚Äù he noted. He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report. \"The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on,\" El-Rufai said. The politician, who has been seen with opposition figures recently, did not rule out moving to another party before the next general elections in 2027.

       " 'A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as \"clearly imagined\" and \"not real\", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk. The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor\\'s donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( ¬£1.7m) to the group to help it \"further its messages of racial hatred and separation\".  But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and \"contrary to public policy\". Trump has referred to the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were \"racist ownership laws\" and previously condemned the \"genocide of white people\". Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced. Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US. The court action was brought by Mr Gray\\'s four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust. In it, they claimed that their brother had become \"obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa\" in the last 10 years of his life.  He died in March 2022. Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed \"genocide\" would occur soon. \"That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to,\" Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light. Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (¬£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group. The Boerelegioen describes itself as a \"civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property\". Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran.  But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray\\'s bequest made was \"vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary\" of his will. \"The only expression of the [Mr Gray\\'s] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for \\'training\\' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real,\" Judge Allie said. On the public policy issue, Mr Gray\\'s siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to \"further... its messages of racial hatred and separation\".  Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion.  Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs  in the court case. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances. The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics. But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country\\'s white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024.  Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.  In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

         "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
         "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House. ",
         "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.  Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.  Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.  Part way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit. Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\" After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country. He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\". During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019. Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\". While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge. The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there. During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters. A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.  Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.  At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada ‚Äì a member of the Commonwealth ‚Äì the 51st state of the US. \"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied. Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on ‚Äì again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir. To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance. But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\" What else do they share? Trump said \"we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country\". But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said. Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".  Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\" But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".  Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".  Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".  Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal. The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase. The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China. But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\". Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections. An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion. Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\" In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".  Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal. At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\" Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\". That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\". He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\". The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US president is invited to a royal estate in Scotland to discuss the logistics of a second state visit.

         "In Donald Trump's White House, the vibes really matter. The personal relationships he develops with other leaders can affect how those nations are treated. ",
         "In Donald Trump's White House, the vibes really matter. The personal relationships he develops with other leaders can affect how those nations are treated.  So it was vital for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to not only master the details of their discussions on Thursday but also to build a rapport with the US president.  The invitation from King Charles clearly set the right tone. Trump looked truly flattered that he would become the first person to enjoy a second state visit to the UK. \"And that's a great honour, because it's never happened before,\" the US president said at the start of their joint news conference. \"I really do call it an honour, but it's not for me, it's for our country. It's respect for our country.\" But the very diplomatic language deployed by Sir Keir over the war in Ukraine ‚Äì like praising Trump for creating the conditions in which a ceasefire is being discussed ‚Äì could not disguise significant disagreements over what a peace deal may end up looking like. While Trump says he feels he can trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to stick to any deal, Sir Keir talked of the need to make sure that any truce endures and does not favour the aggressor. The prime minister's message about increasing defence spending in the UK was clearly very welcome - but he did not walk away with any commitment from the US to participate in ongoing security guarantees for Ukraine once a peace deal has been signed. The two men first met in the Oval Office just before lunch. But the friendly body language and warm atmosphere of that moment did not seem quite so pronounced when they emerged after lengthy talks about three hours later. \"You are a very tough negotiator‚Ä¶ I'm not sure I like that, but okay,\" Trump told Sir Keir as they appeared before reporters after their meeting. And he did not seem to be entirely joking. On the prospect of trade tariffs being imposed on UK exports to the US, the prime minister did seem to have made some progress.  Trump said Sir Keir had worked hard and \"earned whatever they pay him over there\"  in making the case for a trade deal between the two countries instead. That would count as a significant victory for Britain, though any proposed deal would inevitably require lengthy and detailed negotiations. Before this meeting it was unclear how the Labour leader's serious and sober demeanour would go down with the bombastic American president.  But carefully worded praise and flattery set the tone for the PM's first visit to the White House, with Sir Keir saying next to his US counterpart that \"the UK has a true friend in the Oval Office\".  And he was speaking Trump's language when he highlighted how the two countries were ranked one and two in the world as investment destinations, and for golfers too.  Trump responded enthusiastically to the promise of a new chapter in an historic partnership. \"What a beautiful accent,\" he quipped when the prime minister finished his remarks. \"I'd have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent.\" There also appeared to be genuine respect toward the president over the issues on which the two leaders see eye to eye. On other significant matters, they seemed to have agreed to disagree. Which is probably as much as Sir Keir could hope for. Tomorrow it is Volodymyr Zelensky's turn in the Oval Office. A week after Trump called him a dictator, he distanced himself from that description - and his opinion of the Ukrainian president seemed to have softened.  \"I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well.\" The two sides discussed ways to further strengthen the Indo-EU strategic partnership. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. Ben Allen first went out to the country back in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "US attorney general presses FBI to release all files on Epstein",
         "The US Attorney General has accused federal investigators of withholding thousands of documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and asked the FBI to release all the information by Friday morning without any omissions.",
         "The US Attorney General has accused federal investigators of withholding thousands of documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and asked the FBI to release all the information by Friday morning without any omissions. In a public letter, Attorney General Pam Bondi  asked FBI director Kash Patel to also investigate why thousands of documents related to Epstein probe were withheld by the agency. Bondi released the \"first phase\" of newly declassified files on Thursday, but it contained no major new allegations about Epstein nor revelations about his associates. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died by suicide while awaiting trial. The attorney general demanded all information related to the disgraced financier be turned over by 08:00 EST (13:00 GMT) on Friday \"regardless of how it was obtained\".  \"Late yesterday, l learned from a source that the FBI Field Office in New York was in possession of thousands of pages of documents related to the investigation and indictment of Epstein,\"  she wrote in the letter.  \"Despite my repeated requests, the FBI never disclosed the existence of the files.\" Additionally, Bondi directed FBI director Patel to conduct an immediate investigation into why her order to the FBI was not followed. \"You will deliver to me a comprehensive report of your findings and proposed personnel action within 14 days,\" she said. In a post on X, Patel said the agency was \"entering a new era‚Äîone that will be defined by integrity, accountability, and the unwavering pursuit of justice\".  \"There will be no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left unturned,\" he wrote.  The declassified files largely contain documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the US government, according to a statement released by the justice department. The 10 files include a series of flight logs from Epstein's private jet, plus a partly-redacted \"contacts list\". While running for the White House, President Donald Trump had promised to release the \"Epstein list\", a rumoured document that some believe may link high-profile individuals to sex crimes. Bondi was also urged by Republican lawmakers to disclose all information about the disgraced financier. On Thursday afternoon, the White House first handed over the initial batch of 200 files - in binders that read \"The Epstein Files: Phase I\" - to conservative influencers.  The influencers included political commentator Rogan O'Handley, known as DC Draino, as well as Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, US media reported.  But the limited information in the latest batch of files disappointed some Republicans, including Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who leads a House Republican task force on government transparency. \"I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today,\" Luna posted on X. \"This is not what we or the American people asked for and a complete disappointment.\" Conservative commentator Glenn Beck wrote: \"The Epstein files are a total joke. Who is subverting POTUS?\" Most of the \"Epstein docs\"  over the past several years have come out of civil litigation between one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. The 66-year-old had pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008. Ghislaine Maxwell lost her appeal last year against her own sex trafficking conviction for helping Epstein sexually abuse young girls. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. The US president is invited to a royal estate in Scotland to discuss the logistics of a second state visit.

         "Ontario's Doug Ford projected to win rare third majority government",
         "The leader of Ontario, Doug Ford, is projected to have won a third term in office, with voters in the Canadian province giving him a decisive victory.",
         "The leader of Ontario, Doug Ford, is projected to have won a third term in office, with voters in the Canadian province giving him a decisive victory. Ford, who has led Ontario since 2018, called the snap election 15 months earlier than required, saying he needed a clear mandate to fight US President Donald Trump over tariffs he threatens to impose on Canadian goods. Early poll results on Thursday indicate that his Progressive Conservatives secured a third majority in a row - a rare feat in Ontario politics - winning more than 80 seats out of 124 in the legislature. The left-wing New Democratic Party came second, forming the official opposition, while the Liberals were in third place. The election was called by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 10 minutes after polls closed on Thursday evening. Voter turnout appears to be near historic lows. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT) with 97% of polls reporting, just over 44% of Ontarians had cast ballots in the election.   That is essentially tied to the lowest ever turnout of 44% in 2022.  Ford ran his campaign under the slogan \"Protect Canada\", reflecting his view that Canada needs to stand firm against US tariff threats.  Ford has appeared regularly on US television news networks in recent months as a de-facto spokesperson for Canada's position in its fight against the tariffs. President Trump said on Thursday that the tariffs he plans to impose on Canada and  Mexico will go ahead next week, after he delayed them a month in exchange for security assurances at the shared borders. Around 75% of Canadian exports go to the US, and economists have warned that the tariffs would be devastating for Canada's economy while raising costs for Americans. Ontario is home to a large automotive sector that is deeply intertwined with the US - car parts often make several trips back and forth across the US-Canada border before a vehicle is fully assembled and sold. Ford has suggested that 500,000 of Ontario's 16 million people could lose their jobs if the US follows through on the blanket 25% tariffs. He has called for strong retaliation, suggesting Canada cut its energy supply to the US and calling for provincial liquor stores to pull American booze from their shelves. He has also proposed the idea of \"Fortress Am-Can\" - a slogan to sell Trump on a stronger energy alliance between the two countries in a bid to avoid tariffs altogether.  Opposition parties have criticised Ford for calling the snap election, accusing him of taking advantage of the rift in US-Canada relations to boost his own popularity. They also questioned the decision to push for a costly election amid economic uncertainty. Ford has also been the subject of numerous  controversies, including an ongoing criminal investigation into a deal to sell a piece of environmentally protected land for real estate development. At a speech to supporters on Thursday, Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberals, said while the party fell short of forming government it should be \"very proud\" of the seats it gained. \"People counted us out. Tonight, you proved them wrong,\" said Crombie, who failed to win her own seat. She vowed to continue on as leader. The last time a government in Ontario formed three consecutive majorities was last under Leslie Frost, a Progressive Conservative leader who won his third and final term in 1959. He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused. Canada head coach Jesse Marsch says he feels \"ashamed\" as an American by US President Donald Trump's comments on Canada becoming the 51st state. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. Canada's American manager Jesse Marsch is \"ashamed\" that US President Donald Trump continues to label Canada \"the 51st state\". The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Did the White House help end the Tate brothers travel ban?",
         "Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case.",
         "Andrew and Tristan Tate, the controversial British-American social media influencers accused of rape, human trafficking and money laundering, have been freed from travel restrictions in Romania after several high-level White House officials took an interest in their case. It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month. Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media. The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.  They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\". On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending. Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.  When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\" But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania. Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times. And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich. Hurezeanu said the Tates were mentioned during that conversation, but denied being pressured to release the pair. The Tate brothers are Trump supporters and also have ties to figures in his administration. One of Tate's lawyers now works as White House liaison to the US justice department. Paul Ingrassia was part of a team representing the Tate brothers in a defamation lawsuit they filed in Florida against several of their alleged victims. Ingrassia also acted as Tate's publicist and says he got the influencer onto a show hosted by Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host.  He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\". Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk. Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".  Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister. Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\" The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\". McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers. Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere ‚Äì a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits. It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour. The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.  The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist ‚Äì women-hating ‚Äì and sexist views. On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men. In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape. Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms. He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\" Like many other extreme influencers, in the face of criticism he often claims his posts are satire or jokes, mocking his detractors as his messages spread further, propelled by online outrage. The pair's supporters were thrilled with his release and eager to proclaim their innocence, despite the outstanding charges against them. Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\". And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\" The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\". In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\" Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\". \"But I also think it speaks to a legitimate problem, which we have seen in the last couple decades, a problem with men...where there's an epidemic of loneliness, a sense the world is passing them by, a sense that modernity has made it harder to be successful as a husband and a father. I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said. \"There's a pretty good contingency of Trump's supporters who are probably going to welcome this guy and probably even see him as a victim of persecution.\"  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

         "Death of Hackman and wife 'suspicious enough' for investigation, police say",
         "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for \"quite a while\" when the couple and their dog were found on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say.",
         "Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for \"quite a while\" when the couple and their dog were found on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say. Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen of the house in Santa Fe, while his wife Betsy Arakawa, a 65-year-old classical pianist, was found in a bathroom. Authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths \"suspicious enough\" to investigate and have not ruled out foul play. No cause of death was given.  In a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven. Three of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC. \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,\" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting The Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths. \"On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,\" the office said. In a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: \"It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.\" He added: \"There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet. \"This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.\" A sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's \"decomposition\" and \"mummification\" in the hands and feet. \"The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,\" said the search warrant. Near Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground. Authorities say they have requested carbon monoxide and toxicology tests for both Hackman and his wife, and that a cause of death has not yet been determined as they await the results of the autopsy.  A prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa. Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body. The detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly. The circumstances of their death were \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open. But the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed. Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside.  The couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records. The local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant. The detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services. The two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at property, but rarely ever saw the couple. They indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa. The two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand. A recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies. \"No, they're not moving,\" he says in the audio. \"Just send somebody out here really quick.\" The person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying \"damn\" repeatedly.  Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported. He won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992. A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970. Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning. He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein. His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Gene Hackman's daughters and granddaughter say they are \"devastated\" and will \"miss him sorely\", as they led tributes to the movie star who has died aged 95. Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation. In a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: \"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.\"  Morgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news.  Ralph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025.  Viola Davis called Hackman \"one of the greats\" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: \"There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.\" The Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was \"so sad to hear the news\".  \"Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,\" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta. Hackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him \"a genius\", while the Guardian's film critic said his death \"marks the end\" of the era of American new wave cinema. The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman \"a great artist\". In a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: \"Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. \"I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\" Hackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career. They included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s. Perrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as \"a genius\" and one of the \"greatest to grace the silver screen\". She posted on X: \"His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.\" Hackman appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981's Reds. He also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums. The British Academy of Film and Television, said it was \"saddened\" to hear of Hackman's death, describing him as a \"much-celebrated\" actor with an \"illustrious\" career. Spanish actor Antonio Banderas described it as being \"a very sad day for the cinema's family\". Hank Azaria, the actor best known for voicing characters in The Simpsons, said \"it was an honour and an education working with Gene Hackman\" on 1996's The Birdcage. \"Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: 'He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.' Sending all my love to his family and friends. Star Trek actor George Takei posted: \"We have lost one of the true giants of the screen. \"Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it,\" he wrote. \"He could be everyone and no-one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That's how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.\" Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a \"genius\" performer. \"A true legend whose legacy will live on,\" he wrote. As well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award. The Guardian's film critic Pete Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death \"marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave.\" \"Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967),\" said Bradshaw.  \"He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in ‚Äì that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.\" Adding: \"He wasn't gorgeous like [Robert] Redford or dangerously sexy like [Jack] Nicholson, or even puckish like [Dustin] Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged.\" The critic branded his performance \"as the reckless, racist cop\", 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, in William Friedkin's 1971 film The French Connection as \"unmissable\".

         "British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.",
         "British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban. Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are \"misunderstood\". Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain \"under judicial control\" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania. However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.  In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them. Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: \"We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\" \"There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,\" he said, adding that they are \"yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever\". The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US. A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.  \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,\" Mr McBride said in a statement.  Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: \"I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: \"There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk.\" On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft. Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month. The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading \"millions of young men\" to back him \"cannot be overlooked\". Romania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago. Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach \"a form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his \"publicly available tweets\". However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views. He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking. They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny. A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion. In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him. Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action. \"We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,\" the women said in a statement. Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave. \"I am outraged!\" she wrote on social media, \"as a woman, a human being and a Romanian.\" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure. Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed. Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith \"may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty\", it said in a statement in Romanian. Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts. This comes after court limitations were \"modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,\" the statement from the Tates' representative said. The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them. Romania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance's eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US. Senior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December's presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia. Georgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted \"incitement to acts against the constitutional order\". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a \"formalised coup d'etat\". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud. The 38-year-old former kickboxer once said women should \"bear responsibility\" for sexual assault. Brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate arrive in the US from Romania after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted. Prosecutors are investigating a series of alleged offences, after Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round. Charity says German Shepherd has spent her whole life chained to a tree. Reports say US officials asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Andrew Tate and his brother. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Katy Perry to head to space on Blue Origin all-women flight",
         "Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket.",
         "Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. The Firework singer will be joined by Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, CBS presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. Blue Origin said this is the first all-women space flight to take place since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963. There is no specific date for the launch, but Blue Origin said it would take place this spring. Katy Perry is scheduled to be on her Lifetimes Tour from 23 April until 11 November, so this trip is expected to take place before that. \"If you had told me I'd be part of the first all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child,\" Perry said in a statement cited by Newsweek. The NS-31 mission will be the 11th human spaceflight for the New Shepard rocket and the 31st in its history. So far, the programme has launched 52 people into space. A trip on the New Shepard typically lasts about 11 minutes, according to Blue Origin. It is fully autonomous - which means there are no pilots - and takes the passengers past the Karman line, internationally recognised as the edge of space. Blue Origin credited Lauren Sanchez for bringing the mission together, saying in its press release that she is \"honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come\". Sanchez first announced her plan to fly with an all-women crew on a Blue Origin rocket in 2023 in an interview with Vogue, saying they were \"paving the way for women\". This is the latest group of celebrities to embark on a flight to space. Bezos himself flew on the company's first manned mission in 2021. Good Morning America's co-host Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner have also been blasted into space on one of Bezos's rockets. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, made a trip aboard his company's VSS Unity spacecraft in July 2021. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, however, is yet to make a trip. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China",
         "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights. ",
         "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.  Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.  Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March. His comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan. Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security. He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking. On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US. \"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"  She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\". Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.  Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans. Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country. China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year. Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.  Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup. \"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\". \"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"  Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University. On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.  Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations. Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.  Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.  Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.  \"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.  The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market. But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US. China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.   Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs.

         "Three possible paths to freedom: What's next for the Menendez brothers?",
         "After 35 years behind bars, Lyle and Erik Menendez are closer than ever to a potential second chance at freedom.",
         "After 35 years behind bars, Lyle and Erik Menendez are closer than ever to a potential second chance at freedom. The brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents, Jos√© and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, have long maintained that the murders in their Beverly Hills mansion were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than hopes of inheriting their fortune. They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California. A mix of new evidence and public interest has thrown the case, one that has both gripped and divided the nation for decades, upside down.  It's all reached a pivotal moment.  A resentencing hearing is set in March, which could lead to their sentences being reduced - or even their freedom. Separately, California Gov Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's parole board to conduct a risk assessment, a key step toward possible clemency, which could take form in a reduced sentence or a pardon.  The movement in the historic criminal case is significant, but not everyone is happy at the prospect of them potentially walking free.  There are three possible routes the brothers have been trekking in hopes of gaining their freedom.  1. Clemency from the Governor of California Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother's convictions. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to determine if the brothers pose a danger to society. Depending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright. The probe will examine the factors behind their crimes and their rehabilitation while in prison. It marks the first step in a broader process that could lead to clemency. 2. A new trial The brothers' defence attorneys have also asked for a new trial.  They pointed to new evidence about the alleged sexual abuse by their father and argued jurors should be able to consider a lesser sentence, such as manslaughter. But newly elected Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office will oppose the request.  3. Resentencing The last avenue is likely the most significant. The brothers are being vetted for resentencing, a legal process that could reduce their life sentences and grant them eligibility for parole.  A hearing is scheduled for 20 March and 21 March to discuss this possibility.  This effort centres on whether the brothers have rehabilitated after 35 years in prison and whether recent changes in California law apply to their case. In October 2024, then-LA County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n recommended resentencing for the brothers, citing California's evolving approach to juvenile offenders and abuse survivors. Shortly after the announcement, he lost a re-election campaign. The decision now rests with current DA Nathan Hochman, who was elected in November, and is examining the case before making a decision on whether to back the effort in court.  One key argument for resentencing stems from a change in California law that allows offenders who were under the age of 26 at the time of their crime to be sentenced as minors rather than adults. Since Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18 when they killed their parents, their defence attorneys argue that this law should apply to them. If they had been sentenced under today's legal framework, they might have received lighter sentences or had the possibility of parole from the beginning, their attorneys argue.  Neama Rahmani, a criminal defence attorney and former federal prosecutor, told the BBC that a \"perfect storm of PR and politics\" has led to the Menendez brothers having a real shot at freedom. He noted the recent attention the case has gotten from celebrities, a Netflix drama and docuseries on the case, and an \"embattled\" district attorney who was vying to remain in office. \"You're never going to see another case like this. It's a unicorn.\" The Menendez brothers filed a motion in May 2023 detailing new evidence in their case they claim shows they were victims of childhood sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez, and requested their convictions be vacated.  This includes an allegation of rape from a former member of Menudo, Roy Rossell√≥, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse. Gasc√≥n, who was the top prosecutor in LA at the time, announced just 12 days before a tough re-election in November 2024 that he would back the resentencing request. He has denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long-time coming.  Gasc√≥n lost his re-election bid and was replaced by voters with the more moderate Hochman, whose view of the case remains unclear.  The decision also came amid renewed attention in the case spurred by a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story as well as the release of docudrama, The Menendez Brothers. The series introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.  More than two dozen members of the Menendez family have issued public pleas for Erik and Lyle to be released.  Those family members alleged the boys endured horrific sexual abuse at the hands of their father and are not a threat to society. Kitty Menendez's sister, Joan Anderson VanderMolen, argued ‚Äúthe whole world wasn‚Äôt ready to believe that the boys could be raped, or that young men could be victims of sexual violence\". She said that now ‚Äúwe know better\" and \"a jury today would never deliver such a harsh sentence\". But the family isn't in total agreement.  A lawyer for Kitty Menendez‚Äôs brother, Milton Andersen, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and said their \"actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades.\" \"Jose was shot six times, and Kitty was shot ten times, including a shot to her face after Erik reloaded.\"  Mr Andersen believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\",  according to his lawyer, Kathy Cady. Motive has long been at the heart of this case.  During their trials, prosecutors painted the brothers as spoiled rich kids who killed their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills mansion so they could access a $14m (¬£10.7m) fortune. They argued the duo methodically bought shotguns and fatally shot their parents a total of 13 times as the couple watched TV. They then went gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees, buying things like Rolex watches. It was ultimately a confession to a psychologist that helped lead to their arrest when the girlfriend of their doctor reported it to authorities. The brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse. They told the court they feared their parents would kill them if they didn‚Äôt act first. Lyle and Erik testified they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative in their household and they believed their parents were planning to kill them. Family members testified about the abuse they witnessed - but none said they saw sexual abuse first-hand. Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. Lyle Menendez has been married twice. In 1996, he wed Anna Eriksson, a former model, after they developed a relationship through letters. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2001. Two years later, in 2003, he married Rebecca Sneed, a magazine editor. Sneed has remained out of the public eye but has maintained her commitment despite the challenges of prison life. Erik Menendez also found love behind bars. In 1999, he married Tammi Saccoman after a pen-pal romance developed into a deeper connection.  In 2005, she published a memoir, They Said We'd Never Make It, chronicling their unconventional marriage and the difficulties of loving someone serving a life sentence. She has described their relationship as \"fulfilling and deeply emotional,\" despite never being able to share a traditional life together. Court records also detail more about their lives behind bars.  A motion filed in support of their resentencing bid details they both received educational degrees. It also details various programmes they launched behind bars that aimed to help other inmates, including those who were victims of childhood trauma and disabled or elderly inmates. All of this was done, the report notes, \"without any expectation or hope of ever being released\". Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "12 things we spotted in the Oscars class photo",
         "Ariana Grande, Timoth√©e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\". ",
         "Ariana Grande, Timoth√©e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".  Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion. The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.  Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo: Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.  The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two. Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\" Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.  Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year. We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.  The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.  The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days. Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda√±a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro. Salda√±a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P√©rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.  As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.  Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat. James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors. So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?  It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.  Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard. In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating. They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari. The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.  Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race. In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.  She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.  Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.  The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.  Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.  It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year. Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley. Timoth√©e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.  In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood. However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.  Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan. Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.  Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.  Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump. The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes. The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield. Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners. Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo. But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P√©rez star Karla Sof√≠a Gasc√≥n. The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.  However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars. Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year. But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category. Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.  In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.  Look back on previous class photos: 2024: 10 things we spotted from Margot Robbie to Billie Eilish 2023: Brendan Fraser has a 'whale of a time 2020: From Quentin Tarantino to a Frozen couple 2019: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper among stars 2018: Cardboard cutouts and splashes of colour 2017: Pharrell Williams dresses down Note: there were no class photos taken during Covid Authorities say there was no sign the couple had sustained any injuries, but no cause of death has been given. Morgan Freeman describes the actor as \"incredibly gifted\" while Clint Eastwood said he was \"extremely saddened\" by the news.  As the Oscars race starts to take shape, here's the ABC (Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave) of films to watch. Mark Cunningham runs Sherborne Cinema as a \"labour of love\", as film screenings mark its birthday. The much-celebrated actor's filmography includes Oscar-nominated dramas to comedic roles.

Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year. A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\" Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates. How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates. Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans. He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population. Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs. But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\" Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US. Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems. Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation. Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living. Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money. But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care. As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth. Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity. Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling. \"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said. The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government. Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump. Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister. Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation. His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race. Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit. Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine. All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there. Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030. Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US. Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances. A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change. But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy. Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada. Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax. \"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said. Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday.

         "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
         "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid. ",
         "Sir Keir Starmer's promise to increase defence spending will have several consequences.  It may one day actually strengthen the UK's ability to defend itself. More immediately it will mean billions less spent on foreign aid.  But what will it buy the prime minister diplomatically in Washington? In times past visiting dignitaries would give emperors gifts and tributes. Starmer  will now turn up at the White House on Thursday with a large goodie bag marked \"more defence spending\". Donald Trump is just the latest in a long line of US presidents urging European powers to spend more on their own defence.  The prime minister will be able to say to the president that he has heard the call and acted. He might not want Trump to ask too many detailed questions: What does an added 0.2% of GDP mean in real money? When will the UK actually spend 3% on defence? But Starmer will want to land the idea that the UK is responding to Trump's agenda. Early signs are positive. Peter Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defence, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, John Healey, and described the increase as \"a strong step from an enduring partner\". So Starmer's announcement may well get his foot in the door at the White House and a hearing from the president.  But will it help him make the case for the security of Ukraine and Europe? Will Trump now be more amenable to allowing both a seat at the negotiating table? Will Trump be more open to the idea that the United States should play a role guaranteeing post-war Ukraine's security, giving air, logistics and intelligence cover to European forces helping to keep the peace on the ground? The answer to those questions is not clear cut. The prime minister may suggest the UK is showing leadership, pointing the way for other European allies to follow suit. He may also argue that the defence hike shows the UK will not have to make what he calls the \"historic mistake\" of having to choose between Europe and the US, something made much harder by the US decision to vote with Russia against Ukraine and Europe at the United Nations on Monday. The problem is that Trump and his administration have made it clear that their security priority is China and Europe will just have to do more to look after itself.  Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, told the BBC: \"The reality is that whatever we do on defence, the US is going to pivot elsewhere, it is not going to take the lead role in European security that it has done for more than half a century.\" In that context, the government's promised increase in defence spending may be seen as a short-term tactical move ahead of Starmer's visit to Washington, rather than an historic response to the existential geopolitical changes posed by Trump's election.  European diplomats told me they were underwhelmed by the UK defence offer, saying it was not enough to have a real impact. They said the UK would have to spend at least 3% of national wealth soon to give itself a chance to develop the capability it would need. To do that, the government would have to do more than raid the development budget. Aid charities noted that their spending was a soft target compared to those of massive spending departments such as welfare, health and education.  But few politicians of any political colour appear prepared to start making an argument for a transformation of the post-war European welfare model and prepare voters for a massive change in defence spending. For now, the government is cutting foreign aid and international charities are furious.  The reduction from 0.5% of national income to 0.3% means ¬£6bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. Given that billions of this budget still pays for asylum seekers' hotels here in the UK, the actual amount spent on aid overseas will be about 0.15%. The prime minister said the UK would use this remaining aid money to help Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza, tackle climate change, and support multinational efforts on global health. Aid charities were stunned. Save the Children said it was betrayal of the world's most vulnerable children. The One campaign said it would create huge problems for the delivery of vital humanitarian assistance. The aid network BOND said there would be devastating consequences for millions of marginalised people. All this after Donald Trump froze America's development spending arm, USAID.  By cutting foreign aid, the government has broken a manifesto commitment to protect the budget. It has also damaged its policy of using aid to engage more closely with countries in the global south.  David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee and former Labour foreign secretary, said the cut was \"a blow to Britain's proud reputation as a global humanitarian and development leader\".

         "BBC visits US supermax jail the government hopes will solve UK crisis",
         "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
         "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\" \"England.\" \"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says. \"Do you?\" I ask. \"A lot better than where I was before.\" Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment. No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison. \"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\" Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well. Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation. Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison. \"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\" The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%). The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood. \"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\" She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\" The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet. \"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\" What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\" As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence. More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book. Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle. \"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says. It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive. \"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says. But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison. Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete. \"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\" It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding ‚Äì and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers? The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime. The child who died was unvaccinated during an outbreak that has infected more than 120 people. Villagers near HMP Long Lartin regularly see criminal activity, and some fear reprisals. The crew capsule safely landed in the desert after reaching suborbital space. A package laden with cannabis and other illicit items was seized close to HMP Manchester. An inspector says, despite inmates being treated well, education and work provision has \"collapsed\". Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "US measles outbreak kills child for first time in a decade",
         "A rapidly spreading outbreak of measles in Texas has killed one person, health officials said on Wednesday.",
         "A rapidly spreading outbreak of measles in Texas has killed one person, health officials said on Wednesday. It marks the first mortality from measles in the US in nearly a decade. The victim was an unvaccinated child who died in a Texas hospital after testing positive for measles, according to the state's health department.  The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Tuesday that it was aware of 124 cases diagnosed since the outbreak began last month, up from 90 on Friday. Almost all cases - 101 - were in patients 17 and younger. Speaking at the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's current term on Wednesday, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed that there had been two deaths.  However, Katherine Wells, the director of the public health department in Lubbock, Texas, where the death occurred, clarified later that there has only been one. The US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC clarifying the number of deaths.  The US declared that measles had been \"eliminated\" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Currently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children. Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. He also said his department was monitoring the current outbreak closely. A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death. Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). There were 285 cases of measles reported in the US for all of last year, the highest number since 1,274 in 2019. So far, 18 people in the current outbreak have had to go to hospital, according to the Texas health department. Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine. Five people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said.  New Mexico's congressional delegation pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to \"launch a vaccination promotion campaign\" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures,  in a letter on Monday. \"Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,\" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote.  \"Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency.\"  Meanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week. The Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media. Most US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC. Vaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called \"herd immunity\". \"Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,\" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \"Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine.\" Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. Geraldine hopes the new NHS network can further diagnosis and treat the rare genetic disease. It gives general practices a big funding boost, as well as reducing red tape and targets. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.

         "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a $1bn (¬£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high.",
         "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a $1bn (¬£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. Officials said they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programs. More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks this year, according to USDA data. The bird culling has caused the average price for a dozen eggs in the US to hit $5 in January, a 53% increase from 2024 - and the USDA said prices could rise an additional 41%. The Trump administration said it will provide commercial egg farms with best practices and consulting services for free, and pay up to 75% of the costs to address vulnerabilities to help prevent the spread of bird flu. To address the threat of an egg shortage for US consumers, the government said it was willing to  consider temporarily importing eggs that meet US safety standards.  The USDA also said it will eliminate regulations that they say raise the cost of eggs. The policy changes are not expected to have an immediate affect on egg prices, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins told the BBC's media partner CBS News.  \"This is more of a long-term solution, but what I can say is that those prices should start coming down maybe this spring, this summer as we work to implement some of those bigger-picture solutions,\" Rollins said. Soaring egg prices in the US have had some surprising knock on effects. In New York City, where a dozen eggs can fetch $14, some stores have reportedly started successfully selling single eggs - called \"loosies\" - to those unwilling to shell out for a full dozen. In February, thieves in Pennsylvania stole over 100,000 eggs worth $40,000 from the back of a lorry.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Four weeks after giving birth to her second child, Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen cradled her baby son in her arms as she cast a crucial vote on the House floor.",
         "Four weeks after giving birth to her second child, Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen cradled her baby son in her arms as she cast a crucial vote on the House floor. Unable to vote remotely due to congressional rules, the Colorado Democrat flew across the country to oppose a multi-trillion-dollar budget deal, which narrowly passed in the House of Representatives. \"Unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to vote remotely after giving birth, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from representing my constituents,\" Pettersen said on Tuesday. The congresswoman - the 14th lawmaker to give birth while in office - now leads a bipartisan push for more flexibility for members with growing families.   In January, she introduced legislation allowing proxy voting for up to 12 weeks for members  who have \"given birth or whose spouse have given birth and pregnant members who are unable to travel safely or have a serious medical condition\". The bill has 137 bipartisan co-sponsors. Proxy voting - where a lawmaker designates another to vote on their behalf - was temporarily allowed during the pandemic, but current House rules prohibit it.  The restriction allowed some to see the unintended benefits of proxy voting for those recovering from childbirth or illness, but critics argued the policy was being abused.   More than 100 Republican members of the House of Representatives, including current Speaker Mike Johnson, filed lawsuit to end the practice, arguing it was unconstitutional. The legal argument failed, but when Republicans regained control of the House in 2023, former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy ended proxy voting.  Pettersen and another Republican congresswoman who gave birth in 2023 continue to push for flexibility for new parents on Capitol Hill.  Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who gave birth in 2023, missed 137 votes in the weeks after she gave birth. Doctors had advised her not to travel while recovering from a difficult birth. Luna called the inability to proxy vote a \"slap in the face to every constituent\" who elected her.  \"How is it not discriminatory to tell a duly elected member of Congress that she can't vote because she gave birth to a child?\" she said in a video statement  last month. \"New mothers in Congress should not be forced to choose their careers over children or choose children over careers.\" But Republican leadership has yet to budge. \"I have great sympathy, empathy for all of our young women legislators who are of birthing age. It's a real quandary,\" Johnson said in a statement last month. \"But I'm afraid it doesn't fit with the language of the Constitution, and that's the inescapable truth that we have.\" Jean Sinzdak, associate director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said the pushback, in part, is cultural: many of the leaders of institutions like congress are older men who are not concerned about the trials of young parents and families. \"It doesn't behove the leaders of these institutions to change this process because it's not affecting them directly,\"  Ms Sinzdak told the BBC. The UK parliament now  allows proxy voting for members of parliament who are new parents, experiencing childbirth complications or need fertility treatment. The European parliament currently has no provisions to allow heavily pregnant members to vote if they can't physically make it to Strasbourg, the formal seat of the office. Pettersen and Luna are now trying to bypass Johnson and put the legislation  to a floor vote - it is a tough road but it may be their best shot unless the thinking surrounding proxy voting changes.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "Trump to invite Philadelphia Eagles to  White House after Super Bowl win",
         "President Donald Trump has said he will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions may decline the invitation. ",
         "President Donald Trump has said he will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions may decline the invitation.  \"Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them.\" The Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media report. Rumours of the Eagles declining an invitation to the White House created a firestorm on social media after a weeks-old report from The US Sun resurfaced online. The Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 earlier this month, securing the team's second Super Bowl. Sports teams visiting the White House after winning a championship is a tradition that dates back to the 19th Century, but in the past decades some have used it to make a statement. Only one of the four teams that won the Super Bowl during Trump's first term in office made a trip to the White House. That was the New England Patriots in 2017.  The Philadelphia Eagles did not go to the White House after their victory in 2018. The president said at the time that the players disagreed with his view \"that they proudly stand for the national anthem\", although the team or players never confirmed that as the reason.  Instead, Trump invited a group of Eagles fans to a \"celebration of the American flag\". In 2017, NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were uninvited from the White House event by Trump after star player Stephen Curry said he did not want to go. The Warriors were not invited when they won the NBA Championship again in 2018.  There were, however, some memorable sporting visits to the White House under Trump. He famously welcomed Clemson University's football team in 2018 with burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's and other fast food restaurants.  Louis Moore, a professor of history at Grand Valley State University, told the BBC that these celebratory visits to the White House are political, even if they do not initially seem that way. \"For some guys [going to the White House] is a lifelong dream,\" he said. \"But in basketball and football and women's soccer,  it's definitely political. The idea not to go is political, and even the idea to go is political.\" He added that the event has become even more political since Trump's first election victory in 2016. \"Early on in Trump's presidency, teams weren't going to the White House. Before that, there were no announcements,\" he said. \"But now you see people announcing that they're not going.\" Mr Moore said that every presidential candidate since the 1930s has sought an athlete's endorsement. \"Presidents want to be around winners, and winners want to be around the president,\" he said. Trump is not the only president who has been snubbed by sports teams and players. NBA legend Larry Bird declined to visit Ronald Reagan in the White House after becoming an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics in 1984.  \"If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,\" he said. In 2013, Matt Birk of the Baltimore Ravens declined to visit the White House celebration because he opposed Barack Obama's stance on abortion. According to CBS Sports, Birk complained of an Obama speech where the president had said \"God bless Planned Parenthood\". Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Thousands of Canadians sign petition  to revoke Musk's citizenship",
         "Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship amid tensions between the Trump administration and Canada.",
         "Hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition to revoke Elon Musk's Canadian citizenship amid tensions between the Trump administration and Canada. The petition, which opened to signatures five days ago, accuses Mr Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty.  In Canada, citizenship can be revoked only if someone has committed fraud, misrepresented themselves or knowingly hid information on an immigration or citizenship application. Mr Musk, who was born in South Africa, holds both Canadian and US citizenship. Responding to the petition, the billionaire wrote on X: \"Canada is not a real country.\" The post was later deleted. The petition claims the billionaire \"has used his wealth and power to influence our elections\" and \"has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty\". Mr Musk has Canadian citizenship through his mother, who was born in Saskatchewan. Launched on 20 February, the petition, already signed by more than 250,000 Canadians, remains open for signatures until 20 June.  It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. But petitions with at least 500 signatures and a member of parliament's backing typically receive a government response, this one may not, as a spring election could dissolve parliament. It was created by a British Columbia author and endorsed by MP Charlie Angus of the New Democratic Party. Angus, a 20-year MP for Timmins‚ÄìJames Bay, has announced he will not seek re-election. The BBC has contacted his office for comment. US-Canada tensions have escalated since Trump's return, with the president repeatedly suggesting Canada could become a US state and threatening tariffs on steel, aluminium, and other imports.  Canadian leaders have pushed back, vowing counter-tariffs. The spat has spilled out beyond government, with Canadians cancelling US trips, boycotting American products, and booing opposing anthems at hockey and basketball games. Mr Musk moved to Canada from South Africa at 18, and worked odd jobs before studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He later emigrated to the US. The billionaire has backed Trump's hardline immigration policies but now faces scrutiny over claims he worked illegally in the US on a student visa.  In a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to President Trump, called Mr Musk a \"parasitic illegal immigrant\".  The Tesla CEO has denied the accusations, and has said he did not work illegally. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a recent biography. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk via his businesses for comment. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "US House narrowly passes Trump-backed spending bill",
         "Republicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for President Donald Trump that advances his agenda.",
         "Republicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for President Donald Trump that advances his agenda. The 217-215 vote was seen as a key early test for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, who cancelled an earlier vote as it appeared he did not have enough support. Several Republicans wanted more fiscal discipline from a budget that includes $4.5tn (¬£3.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile. But the bill eventually passed along party lines, with all Democrats voting against and just one Republican opposed. That Republican was Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a prominent fiscal hawk who wanted deeper spending cuts. One Democrat did not vote. The House budget seeks $2tn in spending cuts over the next 10 years to pay for President Trump's agenda. It includes more than $100bn in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military. It also would extend tax breaks passed during his first term in office, which are due to expire at the end of the year. Trump has said that the public health program known as Medicaid wouldn't be affected, but achieving the drastic cuts Republicans seek could be difficult without cutting major social services. \"Social Security won't be touched, other than this fraud or something we're going to find,\" Trump said during a Fox News interview last week. \"It's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.\" Speaker Johnson has spent several days negotiating with more members of his party who are concerned about such cuts to social services. However, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law. The budget will have to be merged with a separate one that is under consideration by the US Senate, in a process called reconciliation. And even if both chambers ultimately agree on a spending plan, many finer details will need to be negotiated before it can be sent to President Trump's desk to be signed. House Republican leaders initially delayed Tuesday's vote when it was unclear whether they would have enough support to pass the measure. Speaker Johnson and the second most senior House Republican, Steve Scalise, spent hours working to convince wavering party members to back the plan which, as well as tax cuts, would fund border security measures, deportations and military spending. Trump personally called some of the holdouts to encourage them to pass the bill, the two Republican leaders said. \"Trump helped us with a number of members,\" Scalise told reporters. \"Talking to anybody that we asked that really needed to clarify things.\" Three of the four party holdouts who had been initially seen as firm no votes - Representatives Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson -  ultimately voted in favour. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote.  \"We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning.\" Democrats lined up to criticise the budget as a tax cut mostly for the wealthy, which they said would hurt low-income families who rely on the government-funded health care programme Medicaid. The party worked to get as many members in the chamber for the crucial vote, with Representative Brittany Petterson arriving with her son while on maternity leave. The Senate will be under pressure to take up the House's spending framework because President Trump has endorsed it, despite their separate bill which was introduced last week. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "White House takes control of press pool that covers Trump",
         "The White House plans to determine which news outlets have access to President Donald Trump, taking control from an association of journalists after more than a century.",
         "The White House plans to determine which news outlets have access to President Donald Trump, taking control from an association of journalists after more than a century. The changes, announced by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, mean the White House will determine which outlets participate in the \"pool\" that covers presidential events and shares material with other media outlets. The rotation of pool reporters was previously determined by the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), which said the decision \"tears at the independence of a free press\". The surprise announcement comes as the Associated Press fights to restore its access to presidential events after it was blocked. \"The White House press team in this administration will determine who gets to enjoy the very privileged and limited access in spaces such as Air Force One and the Oval Office,\" Leavitt said at a news briefing on Tuesday. She said the changes would allow \"new media\" outlets - including streaming services and podcasts - to \"share in this awesome responsibility\". \"Legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well,\" she said. \"[By] deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the White House will be restoring power back to the American people,\" Leavitt added. Founded in 1914, the WHCA has historically handled some logistics around day-to-day coverage of the president, most notably the \"pool\" of reporters, which includes a camera crew from one of the five major US networks, a radio correspondent and a rotating group of print outlets. The WHCA has long claimed the pool is beneficial both for the president - who is able to quickly disseminate news - as well as for the wider media who receive pool reports, photographs, video and audio. Pool reporters are on-duty every day - including weekends and holidays - both at the White House or when the president is travelling.  BBC News is among the outlets that participate in the radio pool. The WHCA expressed concern that the move will benefit the White House by giving access to news outlets that it sees as sympathetic or friendly. \"This move does not give power back to the people - it gives power to the White House,\" Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich, a WHCA board member, wrote on X.  In its own statement, the WHCA said that the decision \"suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president\". The WHCA said it was not given any notice about the White House's decision before Tuesday's news briefing.  Leavitt, meanwhile, said the WHCA would no longer have a \"monopoly\" on controlling the pool. President Trump was asked about the announcement in the Oval Office later on Tuesday. \"We're going to be calling those shots,\" he said of the changes. Earlier this week, a US judge declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\". The news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", after President Trump renamed it with an executive order. The AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press. The ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events alongside the rest of the pool at the White House as well as Air Force One. A hearing has been scheduled for 20 March.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents.

         "Who is on Trump's top team?",
         "The new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is in place, featuring several contentious picks.",
         "The new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is in place, featuring several contentious picks. Ahead of his return to the White House on 20 January 2025, he appointed Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth as defence secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as health secretary‚Äîboth confirmed by the Senate. Marco Rubio is the secretary of state, while billionaire supporter Elon Musk is advising on mass layoffs, contract terminations, and a drastic federal government downsizing. Here's a closer look at his top officials: Secretary of state - Marco Rubio Florida Senator Rubio, 53, was confirmed as US secretary of state just hours after Trump was sworn into office. He is now serving as the top US diplomat when representing the country overseas, and also the president's main adviser on foreign affairs. Rubio, who is the first Latino person to hold the post in US history, takes a hawkish view of China. He opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences.  Defence secretary - Pete Hegseth Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host with no prior political experience,  was confirmed as defence secretary less than a week after Trump's inauguration. His appointment was highly anticipated amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. \"Nobody fights harder for the troops,\" Trump said of Hegseth. After Hegseth's nomination it emerged that he was investigated in 2017 for an alleged sexual assault. He was never arrested or charged and denies the allegation.  His lawyer confirmed he paid a woman that year to stay silent about a separate assault claim he feared could cost him his Fox job‚Äîan accusation he also denies. Attorney general - Pam Bondi Trump's first pick for attorney general, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew after a week of controversy over a congressional investigation into sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him, which he denied.                Six hours later, Trump named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his replacement. \"Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, tough on violent criminals, and made Florida's streets safe,\" he wrote. Bondi previously served on Trump's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission and was part of his defence team during his first impeachment trial. Department of the interior - Doug Burgum Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, leads the Department of the Interior, which is responsible for the management and conservation of federal lands and natural resources.   A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth. Health and human services - Robert F Kennedy Jr RFK Jr, as he is known, is an environmental lawyer, vaccine sceptic and the nephew of former President John F Kennedy. He recently added leading the Department of Health and Human Services to his resume. Despite having no medical qualifications, Kennedy, 70, now has broad remit over US federal health agencies - including those that oversee approval of vaccines and pharmaceuticals.  Kennedy has endorsed a number of health claims that are not backed by scientific evidence, including many on vaccines, which have concerned many medical experts. Food and Drug Administration - Dr Marty Makary Trump has nominated Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, the organisation responsible for the safety of prescription drugs and vaccines . Trump announced in his nomination that Dr Makary would be ideal to \"course-correct and refocus the Agency\". The Johns Hopkins University professor is an author, surgeon and trained cancer specialist. He spoke to conservative media outlets during the Covid-19 pandemic, questioning the need for masks and expressing concerns over the Covid vaccine among young children, which research showed helped prevent severe illness.  Veterans' affairs - Doug Collins Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins leads the US Department of Veterans' Affairs. Collins was a Trump loyalist when he served in Congress from 2013-21 and an outspoken advocate for the president during both impeachment hearings.  An Iraq war veteran who now serves as a chaplain in the US Air Force Reserve, Collins left Congress for an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in his home state of Georgia.  Homeland security - Kristi Noem Former South Dakota Governor Noem is in a key role in the administration, overseeing US security, including its borders, cyber-threats, terrorism and emergency response. The agency has a $62bn (¬£48bn) budget and employs thousands of people. It incorporates a wide variety of agencies under its umbrella, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Transportation secretary - Sean Duffy The former congressman and Fox Business host leads the Department of Transportation. He is in charge of aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at a department with an annual budget of roughly $110bn. In the role, the secretary can expect to face a number of safety-related aviation issues, including a series of deadly plane crashes in the US in the early months of 2025. Energy secretary - Chris Wright Oil and gas industry executive Wright leads the Department of Energy, where he is expected to fulfil Trump's campaign promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and maximise US energy production. Wright, the founder-CEO of Liberty Energy, has called climate activists alarmist and likened Democrats' push for renewables to Soviet-style communism. In a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year, he said: \"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.\" Commerce secretary - Howard Lutnick Lutnick was the co-chair of Trump's transition team. Trump said Lutnick, as a member of the cabinet, would spearhead the administration's \"tariff and trade agenda\". The billionaire and former CEO of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald is overseeing 50,000 employees tasked with growing the economy and creating jobs, among other goals.  Education secretary - Linda McMahon World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) co-founder and Trump transition co-chair, McMahon, was picked for education secretary. A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. Trump has promised to shut down the education department - a job McMahon could be tasked with if she wins Senate confirmation. \"I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission,\" she said during her confirmation hearing. Treasury secretary - Scott Bessent Scott Bessent leads the Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.  A Wall Street financier who once worked for liberal billionaire George Soros, Bessent was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.  On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a \"new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes\".  \"[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,\" Trump said about his pick.  Labour secretary - Lori Chavez-DeRemer Chavez-DeRemer has been selected by Trump to lead the US Department of Labor - which oversees worker health and safety and workforce laws and administers unemployment and workers compensation.  Chavez-DeRemer had been serving in the US Congress since 2023 but lost her re-election bid in Oregon in the November election, despite winning strong trade union support. Housing secretary - Scott Turner Turner, an NFL veteran and motivational speaker, leads the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), which aims to address the country's housing needs.  Typically, Hud enforces laws, prevents discrimination and provides assistance to those in need, through both low-income housing and helping Americans avoid foreclosure.  Turner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term.  Agriculture secretary - Brooke Rollins Rollins grew up on a farm, but her most recent job was as co-founder and head of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank to promote Trump's public policy agenda.  Rollins graduated from the Texas A&M University with a degree in agriculture development and later obtained her law degree from the same university.  As agriculture secretary, she oversees farm subsidies, federal nutrition programmes, meat inspections and other facets of the country's agricultural industry.  Outside the 15 department heads who make up the core of the cabinet, there are several other roles that are often given cabinet-rank, like the FBI director and the head of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). Some of them require Senate approval, but others do not. Here are some of the important names: Department of Government Efficiency - Elon Musk Trump tapped close ally and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead what he has termed a Department of Government Efficiency.  It is not a cabinet-level department or agency approved by Congress, but it does include paid staff with access to various government agencies. Known as Doge - a nod to a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk - it serves in an advisory capacity to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies\", Trump said.  Musk, the world's richest man, has proven to be one of Trump's most controversial picks as he has suggested massive cuts to the federal workforce and government funding.  Other names to know: Aged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University. The US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'. Watch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.  Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in. Thousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president. The outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change. Trump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters. Donald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking. Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution. Among the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans. The president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The suspect used an ‚Äúimprovised incendiary device‚Äù to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election. A week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds. Republicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.  The president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power. Given all the things they‚Äôve said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump‚Äôs meeting could be really awkward. 'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton. The Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him. The president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory. After Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign. US President Donald Trump‚Äôs new agency is tasked with slashing costs - but faces opposition. A conservative think tank set out a sweeping vision for governing that could influence Trump's next term. What influence has it had so far? The conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now first in line to the US presidency. The full Senate voted in the evening, approving Bondi as the next attorney general, tasked with running the Department of Justice.   Trump claims more taxes on trade wouldn't be a cost to the US - but almost all economists dispute this. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Trump dominates Liberal leadership debate in Canada",
         "Candidates vying to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada faced each other for the first time on Monday in a French-language debate.",
         "Candidates vying to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada faced each other for the first time on Monday in a French-language debate. The stage was shared by four hopefuls: former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Liberal government House leader Karina Gould, and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis. The question of how to deal with Donald Trump dominated the first half, as the US president has repeatedly threatened to tariff Canada and make it the \"51st state.\" Candidates also answered questions about domestic matters like immigration, healthcare and the high cost of living. Early in the debate, Freeland - whose resignation as finance minister in December triggered the collapse of Trudeau's leadership - stated that Trump represented \"the greatest threat to Canada since World War Two\". She frequently drew on her experience in government, saying that she had successfully faced Trump during his first term when she helped renegotiate North America's longstanding free-trade agreement. But Freeland warned that Trump's second term might be worse for Canada. \"He wants to turn Canada into the 51st state, and it's no joke,\" she said. \"That is why he is supporting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's criminal attempt to redraw Ukraine's borders.\" \"Trump wants to redraw our borders too,\" Freeland said.  To counter these threats, Freeland and the other candidates suggested strengthening trade ties with the EU and the UK. Baylis proposed a \"new economic bloc\" consisting of Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, noting that all four countries shared the same values, cultures and governing systems. Carney, who is frontrunner in the polls, focused his message on helping Canada achieve economic prosperity. He proposed doing so by leveraging its resources, including critical minerals and metals, as well as making Canada a \"superpower of clean energy\" and removing trade barriers between provinces. He, too, agreed with Freeland that Trump's second term was different from the first. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\" He added that he would be in favour of imposing dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the US should Trump move ahead with his threat to levy a 25% tax on all Canadian goods starting on 4 March. Gould, the youngest candidate on the stage, positioned herself as the candidate \"for today and the future\", with a message that homed in on how a Liberal Party under her leadership would work to make life more affordable for Canadians. The candidates also addressed shifting US policy on Ukraine. As the four debated, Trudeau was in Kyiv marking three years since the Russia-Ukraine war began. All four candidates agreed that Canada should continue supporting Ukraine. Freeland suggested that money seized from Russia through sanctions be redistributed to help Ukraine's war effort, while Carney stated that any discussion on Ukraine's future could not happen without the Ukrainians at the table. Freeland also suggested that Canada should foster closer ties with Denmark which, she noted. was also facing threats from Trump who has signalled his desire to take over Greenland - a Danish territory. For the second half of the debate, candidates offered up their ideas for how to help Canada reduce its federal budget deficit, tackle crime and increase its military spending. They were also asked about climate change, with both Freeland and Carney saying they no longer supported a carbon tax on consumers - a key climate policy of the Trudeau government that has become unpopular with Canadians. At certain points, candidates also took aim at Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, saying he would be unfit to defend Canada against Trump. Poilievre is currently leading in the national polls, though the gap between him and the Liberal Party has narrowed since Trudeau's resignation. The Conservative leader has since focused his attacks on Carney, arguing that a Liberal Party under his leadership would not be different from that under Trudeau. Monday's debate is the first of two, with a second, English-language debate slated for Tuesday. Liberal Party members will vote for their next leader on 9 March, after which Trudeau is expected to step down. The French-language debate is especially important for Francophone Canadians in Quebec, whose votes are influential in helping decide which party will form Canada's next government. Whoever is elected as leader would become Canada's next prime minister until the next general election, which must be held on or before 20 October. The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused. Canada head coach Jesse Marsch says he feels \"ashamed\" as an American by US President Donald Trump's comments on Canada becoming the 51st state. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. Canada's American manager Jesse Marsch is \"ashamed\" that US President Donald Trump continues to label Canada \"the 51st state\". Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Federal workers left confused as Musk doubles down on threat",
         "US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.",
         "US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination. Just 48 hours after an email asking \"what did you do last week?\" was sent, the office behind it clarified responses were voluntary, leaving agencies to decide their approach. But as this new guidance was shared with federal agencies, President Donald Trump weighed in that workers who did not comply with Mr Musk's demand would be fired or \"sort of semi-fired\". And later on Monday evening, Mr Musk reinforced the ultimatum, granting workers a final chance to respond.  The mail from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on Saturday, instructed recipients to reply with five examples of what they did over the past seven days, without revealing any classified information. The recipients were asked to respond by  end of Monday. Mr Musk, who is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), said that  failure to respond would be taken as a resignation.  The comments fuelled backlash, with federal worker unions and activist groups filing a lawsuit in California to halt the email mandate. Key agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, and the FBI‚Äînow led by Trump appointees‚Äîinstructed employees to ignore the directive. This led to widespread uncertainty, with some workers receiving contradictory messages over the weekend. The result was widespread bafflement, as federal workers faced uncertainty over their employment. Many also expressed confusion at the competing guidance they had been given by their respective agencies.  \"They're succeeding in driving us insane,\" one employee who works under HHS told the BBC, and asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. On Monday afternoon, OPM held a call with the heads of human resources at federal agencies and said it was up to each entity to determine how they want to handle the directive employees received Saturday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The same afternoon, President Trump told reporters at the White House  that Mr Musk's demand was a \"genius\" move. \"There was a lot of genius in sending it,\" he said. \"We're trying to find out if people are working and so we're sending a letter to people, please tell us what you did last week. If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working.\" \"And then if you don't answer like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist,\" Trump said. Mr Musk maintained  he was acting on instructions from President Donald Trump.  \"Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,\" he  wrote on X, apparently referring to workers who did not respond to his demand by  the end of Monday. \"Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.\" \"The email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send!\" he said in another post. \"Yet so many failed even that inane test, urged on in some cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent?\" Despite pushback from agencies led by Trump appointees, the White House insisted, \"Everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump\". \"Any notion to the contrary is completely false,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The statement did not explain why different government agencies were giving different recommendations. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday.

         "A US Secret Service agent who leapt on to John F Kennedy's limousine as it came under fire in Dallas, and was pictured in famous photos of one of the most dramatic events in US history, has died at the age of 93.",
         "A US Secret Service agent who leapt on to John F Kennedy's limousine as it came under fire in Dallas, and was pictured in famous photos of one of the most dramatic events in US history, has died at the age of 93. Clint Hill later became a bestselling author, but was haunted for decades by guilt over Kennedy's assassination. Hill died at his home on California on Friday, according to a statement from his publicist. On 22 November 1963, he was assigned to protect the president's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy. Hill was riding on a car behind the Kennedy limousine when the first shot rang out. He immediately rushed towards the couple and started to climb on to the back of the limousine as the shooting continued. Hill's actions during the assassination were captured on the Zapruder film ‚Äì an amateur home movie that provided one of the best recordings of the shooting. Hill, originally from North Dakota, served in the Army prior to joining the Secret Service in 1958. He was given an award for his actions in Dallas and eventually rose to become assistant director of the Secret Service. However the trauma he experienced during the assassination led him to retire early from the agency in 1975, at the age of 43. He had become convinced that he could have saved Kennedy's life and shortly after his retirement told CBS 60 Minutes that he felt responsible. \"If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,\" Hill said. \"You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?\" asked interviewer Mike Wallace. \"Yes, sir... That would have been fine with me,\" Hill responded.  \"I have a great deal of guilt about that,\" he said. \"Had I turned in a different direction, I'd have made it. It's my fault.\" As the years went by, the former Secret Service agent later told a documentary, he returned to Dallas, eventually coming to the conclusion he could not have saved Kennedy's life. Hill met journalist Lisa McCubbin in 2009 and collaborated on a bestselling memoir, Mrs Kennedy and Me. It was the first of a series of books and Hill and McCubbin fell in love. The couple married in 2021. A statement from his publisher said that Hill had died at home with his wife at his side. A cause of death was not given. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Judge declines to immediately restore AP access to White House",
         "A US judge has declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\".",
         "A US judge has declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\". US District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to grant the news outlet's emergency motion, but set another hearing for the case for 20 March.  The news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", after President Donald Trump renamed it with an executive order. The AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press.  The ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events at the White House as well as Air Force One.  Last week, the US President said that he planned to \"keep them out\" until they begin using the term \"Gulf of America\".  After the ruling on Monday, the White House said it stood by its decision to block access to the news agency. \"As we have said from the beginning, asking the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right,\" the Trump administration said in a statement.  \"We stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies, and President Trump will continue to grant an unprecedented level of access to the press.\" Shortly after the judge's decision became public, the White House put up two large electric signs in the briefing room which say \"Victory\" and \"Gulf of America\". The AP, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next hearing where \"we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a fundamental American freedom\". Soon after taking office in January, the Trump administration signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", a move the White House said reflects the gulf's status as \"an indelible part of America\".  The AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to rename it.  In response, the administration began clamping down on the AP's access to White House events covered by the \"pool\" of journalists that cover smaller events and report back to other media outlets.  On Monday, Judge McFadden said he declined the request from the AP for emergency relief because he did not believe the publication was suffering \"irreparable harm\" from the ban, according to CNN. The judge said the AP could access the same information from notes that other White House pool members had gathered. Still, during several points in the hearing, he called the ban \"discriminatory\" and problematic\", CNN reported. AP reporters still have access to the White House grounds.  The AP lawsuit specifically names three administration figures - Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich  -as it seeks to regain access.  \"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,\" the AP said in the lawsuit.  On a trip with the White House pool to Florida last week, the BBC witnessed an AP reporter and one of its photographers be told by an official that they were a \"no go\" for the trip after clearing security at Joint Base Andrews a short while before Air Force One was due to depart.  Over the course of the next several days, the AP team - which had travelled to Florida unilaterally - was repeatedly prevented from joining the pool of reporters covering Trump at his estate in Mar-a-Lago, as well as a trip to the Daytona 500 Nascar race.  Speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on 18 February, Trump said that \"we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America\".  \"We're very proud of this country,\" he said. \"We want it to be the Gulf of America\".  Last week, dozens of news organisations - including conservative outlets such as Fox and NewsMax - signed a letter organised by the White House Correspondents' Association in which they urged the White House to reconsider its stance on the AP.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes.

         "Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?",
         "The race to replace Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now set, with former central banker Mark Carney and former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland the two biggest names to have declared their candidacy. ",
         "The race to replace Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now set, with former central banker Mark Carney and former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland the two biggest names to have declared their candidacy.  Trudeau will step down from the role after nine years as PM once his governing Liberals find a new leader. They will announce the winner on 9 March. The new leader is expected to be soon thrust into a general election and will also have to take on the threats tariffs proposed by US President Donald Trump.  Many prominent cabinet ministers chose not to run, including Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Industry Minister Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne, who all said they need to focus on their current duties. The early race has narrowed with Jaime Battiste, a member of parliament (MP) from the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, dropping out. Another hopeful, former Toronto area MP Ruby Dhalla, was kicked out of the race over \"extremely serious\" violations, the party said. Those include allegations of inaccuracies in her campaign's financial reporting. Ms Dhalla has appealed the decision.  Here are the four still in the running to be the Liberals' next leader. In his campaign launch, former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney pitched himself as a strong fiscal manager who can help countries navigate challenging times. \"I've helped manage multiple crises, and I've helped save two economies,\" he said in his speech. \"I know how business works, and I know how to make it work for you.\" He also noted the tariff threat from Trump, saying that Canada is facing extraordinary times. Carney, 59, was born in Canada's Northwest Territories and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta.  In his announcement, he sought to highlight his Canadian roots and paint himself as a political outsider.  He has been serving in recent months as a special economics adviser to Trudeau, has long been considered a contender for the top job, though the Harvard graduate has never held public office. Trudeau himself admitted that he had long been trying to recruit Carney to his team. Carney tried to distance himself from the unpopular PM, saying he is \"not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often\". Carney brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero \"the greatest commercial opportunity of our time\". He is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular, like the federal carbon tax, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians. He has recently back away from the policy, saying in May that it had \"served a purpose up until now\". He has received a number of cabinet endorsements, including Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly. The Toronto member of parliament became one of the most well-known members of Trudeau's team. While she had long been seen as a trusted senior official in his inner circle, a rift with the prime minister's office led to her recent abrupt resignation in December.  That was a blow to Trudeau's already-shaky hold on power, helping to usher in his own resignation. The two disagreed on how to address President Trump's threat of tariffs, among other financial policies as Canada faced a C$60bn deficit ($42bn; ¬£33bn). Born to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, the 56-year-old was a journalist before entering politics. She entered the House of Commons in 2013 and two years later joined Trudeau's cabinet with a trade brief after he swept the party to power. As Minister of Foreign Affairs she helped Canada renegotiate a free trade deal with the US and Mexico.  She was later named deputy prime minister and minister of finance and oversaw Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic. A 2019 Globe and Mail profile said depending who you asked, Freeland is either a last, best hope for the liberal world order or an out-of-touch idealist. Her steadfast support of Ukraine earned praise in some quarters but the Harvard-educated MP has had her share of critics, including Trump who recently called her \"toxic\". In her launch -  walking onto the stage to the 1982 song \"Maneater\" - she leaned into her time renegotiating a trade deal under the first Trump administration, and said she would take on the president again. \"I will lead a true Canadian response to the threat we now face. We will be united, we will be strong, we will be smart and that's why we will win,\" she told the crowd of supporters.  She has received the backing of Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani, among other MPs.  Karina Gould, a former trade and investment specialist, has thrown her hat in the ring, declaring she would represent a \"new generation\" if elected.  She was first elected in 2015 and has served a number of roles in Trudeau's cabinet - the youngest woman to serve as a minister in Canada.  The 37-year-old was families minister, international development minister and later Minister of Democratic Institutions, before taking on her current role as House Leader, where she oversees the government's legislative agenda. Gould said \"Canadians have lost trust in our party\", as she launched her bid. Frank Baylis, a former Liberal member of parliament, was the first out of the gate to announce he is seeking the leadership of the party.  He has said he will bring his experience from the world of business to address the affordability and cost-of-living challenges facing Canadians.  Baylis is the executive chairman of a medical device company that was founded by his mother and where he later served as president. It was sold to a US firm in 2021. He is an engineer by training. Baylis served in parliament from 2015-2019 and was a founding member of the Parliamentary Black Caucus.  The leader of the Canadian province campaigned on the need to fight US President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs. He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused. Canada head coach Jesse Marsch says he feels \"ashamed\" as an American by US President Donald Trump's comments on Canada becoming the 51st state. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. Canada's American manager Jesse Marsch is \"ashamed\" that US President Donald Trump continues to label Canada \"the 51st state\". Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Trump names podcaster Dan Bongino as deputy FBI director ",
         "US President Donald Trump has appointed podcaster and commentator Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI.",
         "US President Donald Trump has appointed podcaster and commentator Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI. Trump posted on social media that Bongino was \"a man of incredible love and passion for our Country\" and would serve under newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel. Bongino, 50, who has worked for the New York police department and the Secret Service, is a staunch Trump ally who has pushed false claims about the 2020 election.  His appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, means neither of the top two people running the agency has FBI experience.   \"Thank you Mr President,\" Bongino wrote on social media on Sunday night. The deputy director, who is responsible for supervising all domestic and international operations, is usually a career agent with years of experience. Bongino hosts daily podcast The Dan Bongino Show, whose Facebook posts often attract more attention than those of Fox News and CNN combined. In Friday's episode there was a segment about the FBI, in which he praised Patel  and tried to allay Democratic fears the agency will be used to target Trump's enemies. \"Kash Patel is there for one reason, he is there to make the FBI great again,\" he said. He's committed to fighting crime and only that, he added, calling his new boss the \"change agent\" the FBI needs.  \"How amazing would it be in four years to look back with a good, high-quality, reformed FBI free of woke culture and DEI that goes out making headline, big arrests of real bad guys destroying your community. How good would that be?\" Bongino's appointment comes with FBI in flux after the justice department forced out some of its top officials and demanded the names of agents who investigated the 2021 riot by Trump supporters at the US Capitol. Critics have said that threatened the FBI's political independence. Bongino and PateI are both seen as Trump loyalists. Bongino, on Monday on his daily radio show, addressed concerns about political partisanship in his content.  \"We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set,\" he said.  He later added: \"We are going to re-establish faith in this institution. The FBI belongs to the American people.\" Bongino, who has run for Congress three times, hosted Trump on his podcast ahead of last year's election. Episodes of his programme from the last week include titles such as \"Trump Keeps Delivering And The Libs Are Seething\" and \"The Only People Who Love Crime Are Criminals!!!\" He has repeated Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election and advanced another conspiracy that Joe Biden's administration was behind the FBI search for classified documents at Trump's Florida home.  \"EVERYONE involved in this DOJ/FBI abomination, from the management down to the agents, must be immediately terminated when the tyrants are thrown out of office,\" he said on X. In 2018, when talking about his career as a prolific conservative political commentator, Bongino said: \"My life is all about owning the libs now.\" With a combative persona, he can often be found firing back at Trump's detractors on X, including a long-running spat with horror author Stephen King. In his social media announcement on Sunday, Trump said that Bongino would give up the podcast in order to serve in the FBI role.  Patel was last week narrowly confirmed by the Senate to the lead the law-enforcement agency that he has long attacked. He denied any plans to pursue political vendettas and has promised to \"rebuild\" the bureau. The FBI has 38,000 employees and a budget of more than $11bn.

         "List weekly accomplishments or resign, Musk tells US federal workers",
         "US government workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign - the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce. ",
         "US government workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign - the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce.  The email came after Trump's billionaire confidant Elon Musk posted on X that employees would \"shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week\".  \"Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,\" he wrote. Musk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings. The email arrived in inboxes shortly after Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac). The messages came with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" from a sender listed as HR. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency, confirmed the email was authentic in a statement to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. \"As part of the Trump administration's commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce, OPM is asking employees to provide a brief summary of what they did last week by the end of Monday, CC'ing their manager,\" it said. \"Agencies will determine any next steps.\" In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to explain their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information - before midnight on Monday. The message did not mention whether a failure to respond would be considered a resignation. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees, criticised the message as \"cruel and disrespectful\" and vowed to challenge any \"unlawful terminations\" of federal employees. \"Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,\" Everett Kelley, union president, said in a statement. On Sunday morning, Musk wrote on his social media platform X that \"a large number of responses have been received already\", adding: \"These are the people who should be considered for promotion.\" A few hours later, Musk said on X that the move was important because \"a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all\".  Musk went on to say that Doge believes \"non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks\", claiming \"outright fraud\" without evidence.  Musk has repeatedly made claims of fraud in defending his team's work across a range of government departments and functions. But on Saturday, there appeared to be some disagreement about the latest email among government department heads.  Newly-confirmed FBI director Kash Patel told his employees in an email that they should \"pause any responses\" to the OPM memo. \"FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,\" Patel wrote in a message obtained by CBS News. \"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with the FBI procedures.\" The State Department sent a similar message to its employees and said it will respond on behalf of the department.  \"No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,\" an email from Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary for management, that was obtained by US media said.  The union that represents many government employees, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), was critical of the email and threatened legal action if employees were unlawfully terminated. \"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.  Earlier in the day, Trump touted cuts and told a crowd of supporters at Cpac that the work of federal employees had been inadequate because some of them work remotely at least some of the time. \"We're removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce,\" the president told the crowd at the annual conference in suburban Washington on Saturday afternoon. \"We want to make government smaller, more efficient,\" he added. \"We want to keep the best people, and we're not going to keep the worst people.\" Elon Musk's team has exacted wide-ranging changes to the US federal infrastructure through Doge and with approval from the White House. Thousands of government employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as other agencies, have been fired in recent weeks. The email mirrors Musk's handling of employees after he acquired social media platform Twitter, now called X, in 2022. As the staff there shrunk under his ownership, he issued ultimatums that included a now-infamous request to commit to being \"extremely hardcore\" at work or resign.  Trump has repeatedly applauded Musk's government-cutting measures.  In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk is doing a \"great job\" in reducing the size of the federal government and that he would like to see him \"get more aggressive\" in the pursuit.

         "Just occasionally, there are years when the world goes through some fundamental, convulsive change. 1968, with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Paris riots and the anti-Vietnam War protests in America, was one of them. 1989, the year of the Tiananmen massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the implosion of the Soviet empire, was another.",
         "Just occasionally, there are years when the world goes through some fundamental, convulsive change. 1968, with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Paris riots and the anti-Vietnam War protests in America, was one of them. 1989, the year of the Tiananmen massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the implosion of the Soviet empire, was another. I was on hand to see each of these things happen, and from that perspective it seems to me that, only seven weeks in, 2025 could be a year like that: a time when the basic assumptions about the way our world works are fed into the shredder. The basic reason, of course, is Donald Trump. Since the end of World War Two, each one of the 13 US presidents before Trump's current term in office has at least paid lip service to a set of key geopolitical principles: that America's own security depended on protecting Europe from Russia, and the non-Communist countries of Asia against China. Trump has up-ended this approach. He says he's putting American interests first, way before everything else. Mostly that comes down to the single question of how much it costs the US. In itself, this is pretty hard for his friends and allies abroad, especially in Europe.  But it's made far more difficult by Trump's own personality. No US president in modern times, not even Richard Nixon, let his personal characteristics shape his policies like Trump does. \"He's just like Louis XIV,\" one retired American diplomat said to me, referring to France's self-aggrandising Sun King.  Critics like this believe Trump is both breathtakingly vain, and amazingly thin-skinned at the same time. As a result, the appointees who surround him, people like Elon Musk and JD Vance, perhaps think that their position depends entirely on how much they praise him and back his views. When President Trump claims, with no evidence, that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is corrupt and has a low approval rating, Musk then takes it further: he piles in to say that Zelensky is despised by the Ukrainian people and is feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. No one in the Trump circle today, it seems, will cough discreetly and say, \"Mr President, maybe you should consider rowing back on that statement.\" Judging from his previous term in office, we can be sure that every one of the people around him knows how he detests being disagreed with. And they will also know that many voters wholeheartedly back Trump's approach, and feel they have been bankrolling security in a far-off continent. He has committed himself to stopping the Ukraine war by Easter. He is absolutely correct when he says that President Vladimir Putin is keen on this. Russian troops are, through sheer force of numbers, making slow advances in the eastern part of Ukraine. But the cost in Russian lives is immense. If the process continues, Russia may have to turn to conscription, which would be dangerously unpopular and might even destabilise Putin's regime. Everything Trump says about getting peace is music to his ears. John Bolton, Trump's far-from-subservient national security adviser during his first administration, said the other day that they'd be breaking out the champagne in the Kremlin when they heard the Trump administration's peace plan. It certainly felt like a historic moment ‚Äì not just in Moscow but around the world. Putin has pointedly backed the idea that Trump really won the 2020 election. It may not be true, but President Putin knows that Trump favours anyone who backs his view of things. Why, by contrast, have Trump and the people round him come down so hard on President Zelensky? It must partly be because he's not obediently doing what he's told, such as returning to the negotiating table and striking a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals.  At the same time, President Trump understands that Zelensky is the weakest link in the US-Russia-Ukraine trio, and can be squeezed in a way that Putin can't be. The more pressure that is piled on Zelensky, the quicker a peace deal will come. President Trump never seems, at least in public, to show much interest in the fine detail of any agreement. It's the agreement itself that matters to him, even if Ukraine and its allies believe it's manifestly unfair and allows Russia to come back at some future date and start the war all over again. British and German diplomats whom I know have been enraged by the way Trump went about getting Russia to the negotiating table. \"He had two major cards in his hand,\" said one. \"The first was Russia's isolation. Putin would have made plenty of concessions to get himself to the talks with America ‚Äì only Trump didn't insist on any concessions at all. He just let him sit down and start talking.\" The other card, the diplomat said, was to insist that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato. \"Trump could have banged away about this and extorted all sorts of agreements from Putin, before finally saying OK, well, Ukraine won't join Nato in that case.\" In European capitals it's felt that he threw away both of his essential cards before the talks even started, without any preconditions. Already, though, some European diplomats with experience of US politics are advising their governments that this grand monarchical period in Donald Trump's presidency, where his advisers defer to him (he literally referred to himself as a \"king\" this week), won't last.  Trump currently has control of a pliant Congress and a conservative Supreme Court ‚Äì but in only 20 months' time, in November 2026, there will be mid-term elections in the US. There are signs that inflation is starting to rise in America, and enough people may well be affected badly by the upheavals to want to punish Trump's Republicans. If he loses control of one or both Houses, the power he has at present of pushing through every plan and policy, no matter how controversial, will diminish. But an awful lot can happen in the next year and eight months. Trump's expansionism might embolden China. A major international trade war, sparked off by Trump's tariffs, could open up. The European Union seems likely to become politically and economically weaker than ever. Agreeing peace in Ukraine on Russia's terms will be something entirely new for the United States. In the great majority of negotiations since 1945, Russia has struggled to get its way because of America's economic and military strength.  Now President Putin, having made the costly decision to invade Ukraine three years ago, looks likely to get away with it, and prosper. If that happens, then 2025 will indeed be remembered as a key year: a moment when the history of the world changed, and nothing was ever quite the same again. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic \"Baywatch\".",
         "With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic \"Baywatch\". But now the iconic beach is surrounded by the ruins of burned homes and palm trees, its parking lot a sorting ground for hazardous waste from the wildfires. The beach babes have been replaced by Environmental Protection Agency crews in hazmat suits sifting through melted electric car batteries and other hazardous waste before it's trucked away to landfills. The Palisades and Eaton fires generated a staggering amount of debris, estimated to be 4.5 million tonnes. In comparison, the devastating Maui fires of 2023 generated about 400,000 tonnes, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. Those fires took three months of clean-up by the EPA, which is in charge of removing hazardous waste. But now the agency is hoping to finish their job in LA in just a month - by 25 February - after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the EPA \"expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris\". The decision to sort through the hazardous waste along the coast has prompted protests and as the clean-up of fire debris moves at unprecedented speeds, many are asking if and when the ocean water will be safe for swimming and surfing. \"In this very vulnerable place, they're sorting this very hazardous, hazardous stuff,\" said actor and environmentalist Bonnie Wright.  \"To me, this feels like 10 steps backwards, because you're literally putting this waste even closer to the beach than it already is in the burn sites.\" Ms Wright, who played Ginny Weasly in the Harry Potter films, wrote a book on sustainability and devotes most of her time now to environmental causes.  While their battle to move sorting sites away from the coast ultimately failed, she said activists were successful in urging the EPA to move burned electric vehicle batteries to the Will Rogers site down the road and away from the sensitive Topanga Creek watershed. The EPA said the burned vehicle batteries are an especially dangerous challenge but that the agency has the expertise to deal with them. To sift waste, they need a large space with roads big enough for truck traffic - which is why the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the beach, is more attractive than inside the windy, mountainous roads of the Palisades. When lithium ion batteries are damaged - especially by the high heat and flames of a wildfire - they have the potential for reigniting and exploding days, weeks, or even months after they've been impacted, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's incident commander for the LA fires. \"We have to treat them like unexploded ordinance, or, as the military calls it UXO,\" he said. Although some have questioned the speed with which the EPA has moved to clean up the toxic debris, he said there is no time to waste. \"We have to do this very quickly,\" he said, noting that they started sorting waste even as the fires were still raging. \"If we are delayed, the risk of impacting the ocean, it goes up again.\" Mr Calanog was also in charge of the EPA response to the Maui fires, which may hold clues for how to measure what is safe and reasonable when it comes to testing water and soil samples. Many are concerned about the impacts of heavy metals and chemicals in the air and water after the fires. In Maui, it's been nearly 18 months since the fires and a small part of the coast around Lahaina is still closed to the public. The Army Corps of Engineers - which removes heavy debris after the EPA removes hazardous waste - just finished their last haul from Lahaina on 20 February. But most of Maui has remained open to locals and tourists and the Hawaii Department of Health announced eight months after the fires that the coastal waters around Lahaina were safe for ocean recreation. The scale of the clean-up from the Los Angeles fires, however, is unprecedented and the largest in US history. LA County closed beaches along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch for weeks following the fires in January. Then torrential rain - while helping douse any smouldering embers - caused mudslides in the burn area and runoff of toxic ash and chemicals into the ocean, prompting further closures. Now most beaches are reopened but a water advisory remains in effect along the coast from Santa Monica to Malibu until further notice advising \"beach goers may recreate on the sand but continue to be advised to stay away from visible fire debris and to stay out of the ocean water during any posted ocean advisory\". Only the most dedicated and local surfers could access the beaches in the burn area anyway - there's no parking or stopping for about 9 miles along Pacific Coast Highway, which is clogged with trucks and workers cleaning up debris. Though some will risk most anything to catch a good wave. While touring the EPA sorting site, Annelisa Moe said she saw two surfers in the water at a popular surf break on Topanga Beach while she watched workers across the street in full PPE handling burned EV car batteries. \"The water looked like chocolate milk with like brown foam on it,\" recalled Ms Moe, who is the associate director of Science & Policy, Water Quality at Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to making coastal watersheds healthy. \"It was one of those days, in between storms, like beautiful, sunny, 75 degree weather type of days,\" she said. \"And so it felt a little bit odd to be there amidst the destruction while we have this perfect beach day.\" Jenny Newman of the Los Angeles regional water quality control board told an LA County Public Health virtual town hall on 18 February that the initial water quality tests they conducted on 22-27 January \"came back better than we expected.\"  But the water board cautioned that people should follow county advisories to stay out of the water near the burn site. Dozens of scientists and volunteers from Heal The Bay and a myriad of private and public sector agencies have also been testing water and soil samples to see what levels of forever chemicals and heavy metals are present in the ocean, but toxic analysis can take 4-6 weeks and there's very little data available. At the Surfrider Foundation, volunteers test the ocean water all year long. But their small lab is testing for fecal bacteria - not arsenic. Now it's too dangerous to expose volunteers in the burn areas, so the staff have partnered with Heal the Bay and the University of Southern California to process their water samples. \"All our community members are ocean lovers. We have the same questions they have,\" said Eugenia Ermacora of the Surfrider Foundation. \"It's a concern, and everybody is asking, When can we go back? When is it safe? And I wish I had an answer.\" Chad White, a surfer who grew up in the Palisades and who protested against the EPA sorting site along the Pacific Coast Highway, said there's no way he would surf there now - it would be too painful to look at the coast and be reminded of what has been lost. And there's too much metal and other debris in the surf. \"It's taken my desire to surf down to zero, not just because of the water quality, but just because of what's happening,\" he said over coffee in Topanga Canyon. He rode his first wave in 1977 at Will Rogers State Beach and taught his son to surf at age four and his wife at age 60. \"It's earth-shattering to someone like me,\" he said of the destruction along the coast. \"That beach means something to me too, and I'm one person. There are tens of, maybe hundreds or thousands of us that utilize the beach every day.\" Many of Mr White's friends lost their homes and he said people are traumatised to see what the landscape and coast around them looks like now. \"Every movie that you see, every film that makes anybody from any other part of the world want to come to California is based on their seeing that Pacific Coast Highway and those beautiful homes in Malibu, across along the beach. They're all gone,\" he said. \"Now it's a toxic waste dump.\" Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "Has Trump kept his day one promises?",
         "Donald Trump made a lot of promises while running for president. He pledged to cut taxes, reduce prices, stem undocumented migration, end wars and strengthen American industry.",
         "Donald Trump made a lot of promises while running for president. He pledged to cut taxes, reduce prices, stem undocumented migration, end wars and strengthen American industry. Some of his proposals were detailed by his policy team or presented by Trump himself, in \"Agenda 47\" videos on his campaign website. Others were offered seemingly off-the-cuff - a product of Trump's \"think out loud\" style and openness to adopting ideas others had suggested to him. In his victory speech on 6 November, he made it clear he intended to keep the promises that sent him back to the White House: \"I will govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept.\" It's become a slogan of sorts in his first month in office, which has been marked by a blizzard of activity and notable progress in achieving some of his goals. In areas such as immigration and foreign policy, Trump has broad power to act unilaterally - and has done so. In other areas, he has run up against legal challenges and political obstacles. Many of the other promises he's made will ultimately require action from Congress, under narrow Republican control, to become permanent. Here's a look at some of Trump's biggest \"day one\" promises and his efforts to turn them into reality. What he's said: \"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one.\" Aug 2024 What he's done: This is perhaps his biggest challenge and a major campaign promise that remains undelivered. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to \"marshal the vast powers\" of his Cabinet to rapidly bring down costs and prices, but it's unclear how. One way, he says, is by increasing drilling to reduce energy costs. A steep price rise in January, the biggest monthly increase for 16 months, has complicated Trump's task. He blamed Joe Biden, who left office on 20 January, and Democratic spending. \"I had nothing to do with it,\" said Trump. At other times, however, he has admitted it's hard for US presidents to control prices. But economists warn some of his policies could fuel inflation and polling suggests voters would like to see him doing more about an issue that often tops their priorities. What he's said: \"On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.\" Nov 2024 What he's done: Immigration has perhaps been Trump's main focus since taking power, with more than a dozen executive orders aimed at overhauling the system. His plan to deport foreign nationals in the country illegally, starting with those convicted of crimes, seems to have widespread public support. But it is uncertain whether he will meet his promise to deport so many. A few raids have made headlines but the number of people being removed does not seem to be record-breaking, according to the daily figures. In his first month in office, the US deported 37,660 people - less than the monthly average of 57,000 removals and returns in the last full year of Joe Biden's administration, data obtained by Reuters shows. A DHS spokesperson told the agency that Biden-era deportation numbers were higher because illegal immigration was higher. Nationwide border encounters decreased 66% in January compared to 2024, according to the White House. What he's said: \"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes.\" Dec 2024 What he's done: True to his word, hours after taking the presidential oath, Trump issued pardons and commutations that paved the way for the release of more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the US Capitol riot. A police officer who was punched that day told the BBC the pardons were a \"slap in the face\". What he's said: \"They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done - I'll have that done in 24 hours.\" May 2023 What he's done: Trump has initiated the first talks between the US and Russia since the start of the war, but Ukraine has vowed to reject any deal hatched without it, and there's been an angry exchange between leaders. President Volodymyr Zelensky fears the US president delivering on his campaign promise to end the war but on Moscow's terms and with no security guarantees. There is also anxiety in European capitals that they are being sidelined, and that Trump may dismantle some of the sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for the invasion. What he's said: Trump told NBC in December he \"absolutely\" planned to end birthright citizenship on day one: \"If somebody sets a foot of just a foot‚Ä¶ on our land, congratulations. You are now a citizen of the United States of America. Yes, we're going to end that.\" What he's done: In one of the first acts of his second presidency, Trump ordered an end to an automatic right to American citizenship currently received by nearly anybody born on US soil. Birthright citizenship is not the norm around the world, although it is in Mexico and Canada, and Trump's move targets those who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas. The right was established by an amendment to the US Constitution nearly 160 years ago, and most legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change it. The issue could be heading for the US Supreme Court after an appeals court ruled against Trump, upholding a legal block on his plan. What he's said: \"On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.\" Nov 2024 What he's done: Trump announced on 21 January that he would levy blanket tariffs on his neighbours on 1 February, linking them to the flow of drugs and migrants into the US. The president has long seen tariffs, which are a tax on imports, as a way to protect domestic industry and increase revenue. Canada and Mexico said they would enact retaliatory taxes on US imports. But Trump delayed starting the tariffs for one month, after promises by both countries to increase border enforcement. There had also been volatility in the markets and warnings from economic experts that these actions could cause prices to rise.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "US measles outbreak leaves nearly 100 ill in Texas and New Mexico",
         "Health officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people. ",
         "Health officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people.  The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Friday that it was aware of 90 cases diagnosed in the last month in the South Plains area, in the north-west part of the state. At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17.  In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas. Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood.  Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease. \"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner. \"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,\" he added. Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash.  A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death.  Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine.  But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots.  Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups. Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement.  In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%.  But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines. In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year. Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period.  Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear. CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs.  Some officials are reluctant to intervene. \"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,\" Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. \"That's just what it means to be an American, right?\" US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe.  Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400‚Äì500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations.  Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. Geraldine hopes the new NHS network can further diagnosis and treat the rare genetic disease. It gives general practices a big funding boost, as well as reducing red tape and targets. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked the US federal government for $40 billion (¬£31.6b) in funds to help rebuild areas of Los Angeles devastated by January fires.  Newsom sent the request to congressional leaders in a letter on Friday. He said the funds would help both immediate and long-term recovery work.  \"I'm asking Congress to have the back of the American people and provide disaster funding to help Californians recover and rebuild as soon as possible,\" he wrote on social media.  The fires, which began 7 January, burned 37,469 acres and killed at least 26 people in the greater Los Angeles area.  The funds would be used for workforce recovery, tax incentives, wildfire resilience and private property redevelopment, Newsom said.  Under Newsom's proposal, the largest share of the funds - 42% - would go to public assistance in debris removal and repair work.  \"The impacted communities have experienced widespread devastation and the total impact on California's economy will take years to fully qualify,\" Newsom wrote in the letter.  Some 150,000 residents have been displaced since the fires broke out in early January.  Much of the Los Angeles area communities of the Pacific Palisades and Altadena were destroyed during the days of blazes.  The request drew support from some lawmakers who represent the area. \"This package will provide an injection of desperately needed federal aid for rebuilding homes, businesses, and community institutions, which will support the healing process for Angelenos suffering the grief and trauma of losing loved ones, homes, and every belonging they cherished,\" Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman, said in a statement.  It's not clear how the request will be received in Congress, where both chambers are controlled by Republicans with narrow majorities. Last month, ahead of his visit to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump told Fox News he did not think the federal government should give California \"anything\" until it shifted water supply to the south of the state.  Following his visit to the Palisades, Trump described the destruction as \"devastation\".  \"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Trump said. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the size of it, we flew over it in a helicopter.\" The 15-year-old was stuck between rocks for six hours after falling while climbing with his family. The pair, who murdered their wealthy parents in 1989, are pursuing three possible routes that could see them leave prison.

He said five other top officers were also being replaced. Gen Brown was the second black officer to hold the post, the holder of which advises both the president and the secretary of defence on national security. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously said that Gen Brown should be fired because of his \"woke\" focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the military. Later on Friday, Hegseth announced the firings of two additional senior officers: Chief of Naval Operations Adm Lisa Franchetti and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen Jim Slife. Adm Franchetti was the first woman to lead the US Navy.  All three top officers removed on Friday were appointed by Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.  Hegseth said in a statement: \"Under President Trump, we are putting in place new leadership that will focus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars.\" Trump said he would nominate Air Force Lt Gen Dan Caine - a career F-16 pilot who most recently served as CIA associate director for military affairs - as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.  Last year, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump recalled first meeting Gen Caine in Iraq. \"He looked better than any movie actor you could get,\" Trump told the audience. In the same speech, he praised the US military but said it was \"woke at the top\". Gen Brown had been visiting troops at the southern US border on Friday, roughly two hours before Trump's post announcing his departure. Rumours had been swirling this week that the president would remove the commander, whose term was set to expire in 2027.  Gen Brown made headlines in 2020 when he spoke out about race following the death of George Floyd. He posted a video message to the US Air Force describing the pressures he had felt as one of the few black men in his unit, including being questioned about his credentials. In 2022, while chief of staff of the air force, Gen Brown co-signed a memo setting out diversity goals to boost the proportion of minority officer applicants while adjusting lower the rate of white candidates, according to the Air Force Times. Colin Powell was the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, serving from 1989-93. One of Trump's first acts after being sworn in last month was to fire the first female commandant of the Coast Guard, citing \"excessive focus\" on diversity.  In November, before he was confirmed, Hegseth said on a podcast that there were many problems in the military, including diversity initiatives, which the Trump administration should \"course correct\".  \"First of all, you got to fire the chairman of joint chiefs,\" Hegseth said in describing the steps he believed Trump should take. The Pentagon also announced on Friday that it would cut its budget and let go of 5,400 probationary employees next week. Meanwhile, a federal court in Maryland temporarily blocked Trump from implementing bans on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. District Judge Adam Abelson ruled that the directives by Trump may violate free-speech rights in the US constitution. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "19 things Trump and his team did this week",
         "Donald Trump has been back in the White House for a month.",
         "Donald Trump has been back in the White House for a month. His fifth week in office saw more dramatic moves as the president continued on his plan to remake the federal government, implement sweeping cuts and reshape American foreign policy. This week he called Ukraine's war-time president a \"dictator\", pledged to make IVF more affordable and dismissed his highest-ranking military officer. If you're after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 19 major moves from the Trump administration this week. Trump on Tuesday called Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" - part of a heated back and forth between the two leaders that also saw the US president appear to blame Ukraine for Russia's invasion. His attacks came after Zelensky reacted to US-Russia talks about the war, from which Kyiv was excluded.  Zelensky said Trump was \"living in a disinformation space\" governed by Moscow after Trump said the Ukrainian leader was down to 4% approval rating among the Ukrainian public - a figure Zelensky said was being spread by Russia. Zelensky's term was due to come to an end in May 2024 but his country has been under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, and elections are suspended. The \"dictator\" line prompted criticism from European leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said it was \"simply wrong and dangerous\". On Tuesday, US and Russian officials held their first high-level, face-to-face talks since the war started but Ukraine was not invited. Top US officials met Moscow counterparts in Saudi Arabia, prompting fears in Kyiv that the country invaded by Russia was being sidelined. On Friday, he told Fox News it was not important for Zelensky to be at peace talks but he would \"of course\" take a call from him. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said talks with Russia were a first step towards negotiating a peace deal and nothing would be imposed on Ukraine. Russian authorities released a US national who was arrested at a Moscow airport this month for cannabis possession. Kalob Byers, 28, was freed hours before the talks between US and Russian officials over the war in Ukraine were set to begin. The US also said it will release a Russian national - Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 on charges related to the laundering of billions of dollars using virtual currency Bitcoin - as part of a prisoner exchange that brought home American schoolteacher Marc Fogel last week. The Trump administration is moving to end New York City's congestion pricing plan, which charges vehicles entering the city in certain areas, then uses tolls to upgrade its aging transit systems. It was launched last month.  \"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,\" Trump said on social media. \"Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!\" In response, New York Govenor Kathy Hochul said: \"We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king. We'll see you in court.\" Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trump's envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers' passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The US Border Patrol said there was a decrease in migrants illegally crossing the US-Mexico border in January.  It recorded 29,000 arrests - the lowest since May 2020 and down from 47,000 in December, according to department figures. Trump took office on 20 January, replacing predecessor Joe Biden.   The Trump administration has promised to clamp down on undocumented migration into the US, which has also included declaring an emergency at the southern border and expanded processes that allow for rapid expulsions. Trump reassigned the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, US media reported. The move came after Trump and border tsar Tom Homan expressed anger that deportation numbers weren't higher.  The Trump administration - and his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) leader Elon Musk - are continuing a cost-cutting drive that aims to drastically reduce the federal workforce. More than 6,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees are expected to be fired, and on Friday the Pentagon said it planned to \"release\" 5,400 probationary workers starting early next week. Around 1,000 employees in the US National Park Service were let go last weekend - roughly 5% of the workforce - according to CBS News. It has also begun firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees, and the head of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union David Spero called the firings \"shameful\". Polling suggests there is public support for less government spending but also concern that Musk's efficiency drive could go too far. Trump's administration is attempting to rehire officials with the US Department of Agriculture  (USDA) who worked on the government response to bird flu before being fired over the weekend, US media report. The terminations came as the latest outbreak of the bird flu has wreaked havoc on poultry and cattle farms, causing egg prices to skyrocket. A USDA spokesperson told the BBC that although \"several\" officials working on bird flu were \"notified of their terminations\" over the weekend, \"we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters\". It's not the first time this has happened - after firing officials with the National Nuclear Security Administration last week, US media reported that the government was trying to reinstate some, but was struggling to contact them. Trump has signed an executive order that will examine ways to make in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments more affordable. Speaking at an event at Mar-a-Lago, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said the order asks that the Domestic Policy Council make recommendations within 90 days to protect access to IVF and \"aggressively\" reduce its costs. During his campaigning, Trump said that IVF treatments would be paid for by insurance companies or the government if he returned to the White House. A row erupted between the White House and the Associated Press (AP) - a global media organisation - after Google Maps changed the Gulf of Mexico's name to the Gulf of America for people using the app in the US. Trump has ordered the body of water to be renamed in US government documents. The AP says that it will not change the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its style guide, which is used by many US media outlets. Trump said on Tuesday that he will block AP from the Oval Office and Air Force One until it stops referring to the Gulf of Mexico. The media organisation sued three Trump officials in response, US media reported on Friday. The AP argues Trump's ban violates the First Amendment and is seeking an emergency hearing to declare Trump's moves unconstitutional.  US justice department lawyers on Wednesday defended their decision to end a criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Last week, the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss fraud and bribery charges against Adams. Seven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. Adams was indicted last year on the charges. He denies any wrongdoing. Trump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the Adams case. On Friday, a judge paused Adams' trial and ordered an outside lawyer to advise him by coming up with arguments against dropping the charges - essentially creating a legal test. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order ending federal benefits for undocumented migrants. The measure will seek to ensure that any federal funds to states and localities \"will not be used to support sanctuary policies or assist illegal immigration\", according to the White House. The Trump administration also suspended a service on Tuesday that helped children who come to the US without a parent or guardian to navigate the immigration court system. Trump said he is considering using a percentage of the potential savings from Elon Musk's taskforce to send payments directly to US taxpayers. \"We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,\" Trump said in Florida this week, without giving further details. Before making the remarks, Musk had posted on his social media platform X that he \"will check with the President\" after a user suggested the pair should announce a \"DOGE Dividend\". During his speech at the Munich Security Conference a week ago, US Vice-President JD Vance launched a scalding attack on European democracies saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but \"from within\". Vance was expected to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine but instead accused European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech. The speech was denounced by several politicians at the conference. Rubio boycotted a meeting of G20 foreign ministers  in South Africa this week, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he will not attend next week's gathering of G20 finance ministers. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told the meeting that a commitment to multilateralism and international law is vital to solving global crises. Announcing his refusal to attend, Rubio said South Africa was \"using G20 to promote 'solidarity, equality, & sustainability.' In other words: DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and climate change\".  Bessent said he had other commitments in Washington. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has told US military services to identify $50bn in cuts next year so the money can be used elsewhere for Trump's priorities. The deputy defence secretary said in a statement on Wednesday that \"excessive bureaucracy\" and \"unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called 'climate change' and other woke programs\" would end. Late Friday night, Trump announced on Truth Social, his social media platform, that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was leaving, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has restored funding for 9/11-related cancer research after Doge attempted to cancel it last week, according to officials. The $257,000 (¬£199,000) contract goes towards data processing to compare cancer incidence rates among firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center toxins with firefighters who were not. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: \"9/11 cancer research and funding for FDNY should have never been on the chopping block\". Trump's motorcade drove round the Daytona racetrack in the opening event of the season's Nascar series. The president's Air Force One jet gave a flyby for spectators before he met the drivers and led them for a lap around the circuit. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown was fired as the highest-ranking military officer in the country, responsible for advising the president and defence secretary. On Friday evening, Trump took to social media to announce the departure of Gen Brown, who was the second black officer in US history to hold the post. The president said five other top officers were being replaced. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously said Gen Brown should be fired because of his \"woke\" focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the military. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "Trump says Starmer and Macron 'haven't done anything' to end Ukraine war",
         "US President Donald Trump has said French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"haven't done anything\" to end the war in Ukraine, ahead of their visits to the White House next week.",
         "US President Donald Trump has said French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"haven't done anything\" to end the war in Ukraine, ahead of their visits to the White House next week. Trump also said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had \"no cards\" in peace negotiations, adding: \"I don't think he's very important to be in meetings.\" Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the UK, France and other allies have been supplying Kyiv with weapons and other aid. On Monday, European leaders held a hastily-arranged summit in Paris - a day before US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, and amid fears that Ukraine and Europe could be excluded from peace negotiations. Despite his criticism of Macron and Sir Keir, Trump also praised the European leaders in his interview with Fox News. He said that he considered Macron to be a \"friend\", and called the British prime minister a \"very nice guy\". Macron is expected to visit Washington on Monday, while Sir Keir will be there on Thursday. Earlier this week, the British prime minister said he was \"ready and willing\" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. The BBC has contacted the PM's office for comment.  While European leaders have ruled out negotiating with Russia, they have met regularly to discuss the war in Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK and EU - along with other countries including Australia, Canada and Japan - have imposed more than 20,000 sanctions on Russia. Many European nations have also signed agreements to support and provide aid to Ukraine.  In January, Sir Keir signed a \"landmark\" pact, telling Zelensky: \"We are with you not just today, for this year or the next - but for 100 years - long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again.\" Keith Kellogg, Trump's Ukraine envoy, said he had had \"extensive and positive\" discussions with Zelensky during their meeting in Kyiv on Thursday. Kellogg praised Zelensky as a \"courageous leader\" - only days after Trump referred to him as a \"dictator\". In recent days, Zelensky has held phone calls with various global leaders, who have expressed their commitment to ensuring Ukraine is involved in peace talks.  Trump said on Friday that Russia and Ukraine would not want to begin peace talks without his own personal involvement. He also continued to criticise Zelensky, saying: \"I've been watching this man for years now as his cities get demolished, as his people get killed, as his soldiers get decimated. \"I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards, and you get sick of it. You just get sick of it, and I've had it.\" After criticising Zelensky over the past week - using talking points that analysts say sound more like they originate in Moscow than Washington - Trump offered that \"of course\" he would take a phone call from Ukraine's president. He insisted several times that Zelensky was to blame for failing to prevent the war, saying that Russia could have been \"talked out\" of invading Ukraine. Asked about Ukraine's absence from peace talks in Saudi Arabia this week, Trump said that Russia \"found it impossible to make a deal with Zelensky\". He said he believed that Russia sincerely wanted a deal to end the war, but that President Vladimir Putin \"doesn't have to make a deal\". US Vice-President JD Vance later hit back at critics who said that Trump's stance on Russia amounted to \"appeasement\". \"We are negotiating to end the conflict. It is 'appeasement' only if you think the Ukrainians have a credible pathway to victory. They don't, so it's not,\" he said in a post on X. Meanwhile, Kyiv and Washington appeared to be inching closer to signing a deal that would give the US rights to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. Trump has styled this as a way for Ukraine to repay the US for its past military support. He told reporters on Friday that the US and Ukraine were \"pretty close\" to signing the deal, adding that the US would \"get our money back\". In a video address late on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement, which \"can add value to our relations\". But he stressed that \"what matters most is getting the details right\". The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he \"cannot sell our state\". White House Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Friday that Zelensky was \"going to sign that deal\". Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Hunter Schafer, a transgender woman and star of hit HBO teen drama Euphoria, has said a new US passport lists her as male, despite selecting female when she filled out the paperwork. \"I was shocked,\" Schafer said in a TikTok video showing the \"M\" marker on her new travel document. Her previous passport listed her as female. \"I just didn't think it was actually going to happen,\" the 26-year-old added, criticising US President Donald Trump's policies on gender. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order recognising only two sexes and declaring they cannot be changed. The US now issues passports with just male or female designations, based on a person's sex recorded at birth.  Previously, Americans could select their gender for passports and also request to be listed as \"X\", which the Biden administration said in 2022 was being offered as an option \"for non-binary, intersex and gender non-confirming individuals\". Schafer said she had applied for a new passport after losing her old one while filming overseas.  She filled out forms indicating she was female, but when she picked up her replacement, it listed her as male, according to her post. Schafer said she intended to travel abroad next week and anticipated challenges at the airport because of the new passport.  She said she believed it was \"a direct result of the administration our country is currently operating under\". Trump's executive order says of the male and female sexes that they \"are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality\". It adds: \"'Sex' is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of 'gender identity'.\" The US state department, which issues passports, says on its website that it will \"only issue passports with an M or F sex marker that match the customer's biological sex at birth\". After learning about Trump's executive order, Schafer said her first reaction was: \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" \"Today I saw it,\" she told fans. Schafer added: \"I just feel like it's important to share that it's not just talk - that this is real and it's happening and no-one - no matter their circumstance, no matter how wealthy or white or pretty or whatever - is excluded.\" The Euphoria star said she changed her gender markers for her driver's licence and passports when she was a teenager, but that her birth certificate was never amended. \"I'm pretty sure it's going to come along with having to out myself to border patrol agents and that whole gig, much more often than I would like to or is really necessary,\" she said. On the HBO drama, now in its third season, she plays a transgender teenager, Jules Vaughn, who has a complicated relationship with the main character Rue. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "Trump administration to cut thousands of jobs at Pentagon and IRS",
         "The Trump administration is cutting more than 11,000 jobs at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pentagon, as part of its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce.",
         "The Trump administration is cutting more than 11,000 jobs at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pentagon, as part of its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Around 6,000 layoffs at the IRS began on Thursday, coming in the middle of tax season as millions of Americans file their returns. The defence department plans to axe more than 5,000 jobs next week as part of a goal to reduce its nearly million-strong civilian workforce by 5 to 8%, the Pentagon said on Friday. It will also put a hiring freeze in place. The Trump administration has appointed Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to implement the layoffs as part of a cost-cutting drive. The probationary workers who are expected to lose their jobs at the IRS \"were not deemed as critical to filing season\", according to an email seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Most Americans have a deadline of 15 April to file their taxes, though the government allows extensions under some circumstances. Probationary employees are generally those on the job for less than a year. A person who has been a long-serving employee but moved to a new position is also often considered in a probationary position.  The BBC has contacted the IRS and treasury department for comment. Reports suggest the terminations will target mostly new and newly promoted employees, with half of the cuts hitting an office known as the Small Business/Self-Employed (SBSE) Division. The email from SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert says that \"while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week\". About 83,000 people worked for the IRS as of the 2023 fiscal year. Many of the targeted roles appear to deal with compliance matters, or ensuring Americans pay what the government says they owe. Linda Bilmes, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, told the BBC: \"What people like even less than paying taxes is not being able to reach someone to help them pay their taxes accurately.\" The Biden administration had secured $80bn (¬£63bn) in funding for new resources and staff at the IRS, to help the government bring in more revenue. Republicans, who generally advocate for lower taxes, opposed the effort and have long targeted the IRS for funding cuts.  In an interview on Fox News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's \"goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay\".  The president has proposed an \"External Revenue Service\" to generate funds from tariffs, or taxes on foreign imports, instead. The firings at the Pentagon were expected to initially affect about 5,400 probationary workers beginning next week before freezing hiring, a defence department statement said. But these job losses might not be the last. \"We anticipate reducing the Department's civilian workforce by 5-8% to produce efficiencies and refocus the Department on the President's priorities and restoring readiness in the force,\" the statement added. The defence department is the largest government agency, with a civilian workforce of about 950,000 employees, according to Reuters. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has supported these cuts, posting on X last week that the Pentagon needs \"to cut the fat (HQ) and grow the muscle (warfighters)\". Polling indicates some discomfort among Americans for Trump's changes to the federal workforce. A Washington Post/Ipsos poll suggests that 54% of Americans disapproved of the way Trump is managing the federal government, compared to 44% who approved. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. \"What a beautiful accent,\" the US president said of the British leader.

         "Are planes crashing more often?",
         "After a series of high-profile disasters, some social media users suggested that air travel accidents were becoming more frequent.",
         "After a series of high-profile disasters, some social media users suggested that air travel accidents were becoming more frequent. Videos of hair-raising near misses began to trend online and the US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy sought to calm fears in an interview with the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He told viewers that the recent spate of air disasters in America were \"very unique\".  Duffy's intervention came after several serious incidents, including a mid-air collision in January between a commercial airliner and a military helicopter in Washington DC, in which 67 people died. Footage of a plane flipping over after landing in poor weather in Toronto, Canada, has also been widely shared online, further fuelling alarm. And while polling on the subject is limited, one recent Associated Press survey suggested these startling images of accidents have had some impact on some US consumers' confidence in flying. But BBC Verify has analysed data in the US and worldwide and found that over the past two decades there has been a general downward trend in air accidents. For the US, figures on air accidents have been compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) up to the end of January this year. This NTSB data shows a general fall in air accidents in the US from 2005 to 2024 despite a significant increase in the overall number of flights over this period. It also shows that the figure for January 2025 (52), was lower than it was in January last year (58) and January 2023 (70). Data from International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN body which monitors global air incidents, shows that the number of worldwide accidents per million plane departures has also seen a clear downward trend between 2005 and 2023. The ICAO definition of an aircraft accident is very broad and not only includes those in which passengers or crew are seriously injured or die, but also incidents where an aircraft is damaged and needs repairs, or goes missing. Data on the number of deaths in air accidents globally also shows that there has been a decrease over the same period, albeit with spikes in some years reflecting major air disasters. In 2014, two such events contributed to a significant spike. In March, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared as it travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. In July, another Malaysian Airlines plane, MH17, was shot down by a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine, killing almost 300. Data sets such as this are inclined to see sudden, large fluctuations, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge, told BBC Verify. \"If you count fatalities rather than accidents it's bound to be extremely volatile and sensitive to a single large accident,\" he said.  \"Random events do not occur evenly - they tend to cluster. So unfortunately we can expect aircraft accidents to be appear to be connected, even when they are not.\" Regarding the series of high-profile accidents over the past few months, Ismo Aaltonen, formerly Finland's chief air disaster investigator, told BBC Verify they are not an indication of a decline in aircraft safety. \"It's very unlucky that we had this period of many different kind of accidents, but people should not draw any conclusions based on this because they are such different cases,\" he said. He noted that some incidents over the past few months were unforeseeable, citing an Azerbaijan Airlines flight which crashed in Kazakhstan in December after being targeted by a Russian anti-aircraft missile. Marco Chan, a former pilot and senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University, told BBC Verify that the rise in awareness of air disasters is being further fuelled because \"accidents are getting increasing exposure from social media platforms\". One video circulating on TikTok - which has been pulled from a Superman film - shows the hero preventing a jet from smashing into a stadium. Accompanying the clip is the caption: \"Pete Buttigieg every single day the last four years, judging by current events.\" The viral clip suggests that aviation disasters have grown since the ex-US transportation secretary left office in January. A string of incidents in recent years involving the Boeing 737 Max aircraft has also attracted significant attention in the media and on social media, especially after a door blew out mid-flight in January 2024. Concerns over that and several other incidents saw some customers boycott planes manufactured by Boeing and a collapse in the company's share price. Experts told BBC Verify that incidents such as these and major crashes are thoroughly investigated by authorities. New details and data from accidents are fed into pilot training simulators so that they can prepare for similar scenarios in the future. \"If you look at simulators today, how advanced they are, they are like real aircraft,\" said Ismo Aaltonen. \"It's completely different to when I started flying more than 40 years ago.\" Regulators can also impose penalties for safety violations which include fines, license suspensions and operational restrictions. Airlines can also be banned from countries and blocs if they don't adhere to safety standards. Despite the recent spate of incidents, air travel remains by far the safest form of travel. Of all transport-related deaths in 2022 in the US, over 95% occurred on the road, according to the latest available figures from the US Department of Transportation. Fewer than 1% were related to air travel. And if you look at the figures in terms of fatalities per distance travelled, the comparative safety of air travel is even clearer. In 2022, there were just 0.001 passenger deaths per 100,000,000 miles onboard airlines, compared with 0.54 in passenger vehicles, according to the most recent figures from the National Safety Council, a US-based non-profit organisation. \"Be careful how you make your trip to the airport\" said Mr Aaltonen. \"That's the most dangerous part of the trip compared to the actual flight.\" What do you want BBC Verify to investigate? Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. An Australian couple said it was \"traumatic\" to sit next to the body of the woman who died mid-flight. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "French far-right leader cancels speech, accusing Bannon of 'Nazi' gesture",
         "French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has cancelled a planned speech in the US, after President Donald Trump's former top adviser made a hand gesture that some likened to a Nazi salute.",
         "French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has cancelled a planned speech in the US, after President Donald Trump's former top adviser made a hand gesture that some likened to a Nazi salute. Steve Bannon yelled \"fight, fight, fight\" before extending his right arm, fingers pointed and palm down, during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) near Washington DC on Thursday evening. Bardella, who leads France's National Rally party, was scheduled to speak at the event on Friday. He said in a statement that he was cancelling his appearance over what he called a \"gesture referring to Nazi ideology\". Bannon denied the Nazi comparison and called the gesture a \"wave\", saying it was the \"exact same wave\" he did on stage at a speech seven years ago in France to Bardella's party. \"If he cancelled [the speech] over what the mainstream media said about the speech, he didn't listen to the speech. If that's true, he's unworthy to lead France. He's a boy, not a man,\" Bannon told the French news magazine Le Point. Inside the halls of the suburban convention centre hosting Cpac, Romanian far-right leader George Simion also disagreed with Bardella's interpretation of Bannon's hand gesture.  \"Any historian knows that wasn't a Nazi salute,\" he told the BBC.  Bannon's on-stage gesture appeared to mirror one from tech billionaire-turned-presidential adviser Elon Musk during Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Musk also denied he had performed a Nazi salute after an uproar. Bardella, seen as a future French presidential hopeful, was one of several high-profile international politicians scheduled to speak at Cpac during the four-day conference, which began on Wednesday. Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss addressed the conservative bash on its first day, telling attendees that the British state was \"failing\". On Thursday, Argentine President Javier Milei handed Elon Musk a shiny chainsaw that he wielded on stage, celebrating sweeping cuts to the federal government by his Doge initiative. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to speak on Saturday, ahead of President Trump's address.  The annual Cpac conference has become increasingly dominated by Trump's Make America Great Again movement, and this year, it has taken on a celebratory tone in the wake of his election victory in November. Speaker after speaker have lauded the blizzard of action launched by the White House in the month since the Republican returned to the Oval Office. Bannon was met with a standing ovation after his speech on Thursday, which ended with the controversial gesture.  \"The only way that they win is if we retreat, and we are not going to retreat,\" he told the crowd. \"We're not going to surrender, we are not going to quit, we're going to fight, fight, fight.\" Bannon was Trump's top adviser at the start of his first term in office before the president fired him. The firebrand conservative hosts the influential War Room podcast, listened to by legions of Trump supporters. He was released from prison in October, after serving four months for defying a congressional subpoena over the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. In another case, Bannon was spared prison time after pleading guilty earlier this month to defrauding donors over a fundraiser to build a US-Mexico border wall.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Ex-Proud Boys leader arrested outside US Capitol",
         "The former leader of the far-right Proud Boys was arrested on Friday outside the US Capitol, police said.",
         "The former leader of the far-right Proud Boys was arrested on Friday outside the US Capitol, police said. Enrique Tarrio, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, was arrested not long after holding a news conference on Friday. Protesters attempted to drown out the event, held near the site of the riot, but Tarrio's remarks to media went ahead as planned. In a statement, US Capitol Police said that after the event concluded and the Proud Boys were leaving the area, a woman put a phone near Tarrio's face. Officers allegedly saw him strike the phone and the woman's arm. At the news conference, Tarrio was joined by several other members of the group and by Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia.  Tarrio and the other Proud Boys announced plans to sue the US justice department over their imprisonment. They criticised prison conditions and said they had used a cryptocurrency to raise funds to launch the suit. A group of about 200 Proud Boys was at the US Capitol riot, and dozens were arrested and convicted before being released after Trump issued a blanket pardon on the first day of his second term in office. Following his release from prison, Tarrio hinted that he would resume his role at the helm of the Proud Boys, although some of the group's local chapters have rejected his leadership. During the news conference, while counter-demonstrators chanted against his group, Tarrio called Capitol rioters \"peaceful protesters\" and repeated conspiracy theories that the disorder that day \"was orchestrated by none other than the government itself\". Both Tarrio and Rhodes were convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the US Capitol riot, which saw supporters storm Congress as lawmakers certified Joe Biden's election victory. One of the rioters, un unarmed woman, was shot dead by police, and a police officer died of a stroke the day afterwards. Tarrio had been banned from the city of Washington due to previous criminal charges and watched the riot itself on TV from nearby Baltimore. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Rhodes was near the Capitol but stayed outside while members of his militia entered the building. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Both were among the nearly 1,600 people pardoned by Trump.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.

         "Shackled Luigi Mangione in packed court over healthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing ",
         "A lawyer for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has argued that the 26-year-old is not being granted the right to a fair trial.",
         "A lawyer for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has argued that the 26-year-old is not being granted the right to a fair trial. The comments came during a brief procedural hearing on Friday, which drew hundreds of supporters - some from as far as Kansas - chanting the defendant's name and wearing shirts adorned with his face.  Mr Mangione arrived in court with his hands and legs shackled, wearing a green sweater and a bulletproof vest. He has pleaded not guilty to the New York charges.  The killing of Mr Thompson, 50, a husband and father of two, sparked a nationwide conversation about the US healthcare system, unleashing pent-up anger at the industry and some ugly reaction.  Chants from Mr Mangione‚Äôs supporters could be heard from the court‚Äôs 15th floor on Friday. His brief appearance drew more people than the number that attended the public gallery in the same courtroom last year for President Donald Trump‚Äôs hush money trial.  Some of Mr Mangione's supporters wore face masks and green Luigi hats, from the Super Mario video game franchise. \"What a joke,\" muttered a court officer watching the spectacle.  Among members of the public in court was Chelsea Manning, who was convicted more than a decade ago of espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks. Investigators say Mr Mangione was motivated to kill Mr Thompson because of anger with US healthcare insurance companies.  In addition to the New York state-level charges, he is accused of federal stalking and murder offences that could potentially carry a death penalty. The separate cases were a source of frustration for Mr Mangione's lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who argued before the packed court on Friday that her client was being treated differently to other defendants.  \"His right to a fair trial is continuing to be impacted,\" she said at the hearing, which lasted less than 30 minutes.  She cited her client's detainment in federal custody and remarks made by city officials about the case as factors that could influence the proceedings. At the beginning of the hearing to discuss a pre-trial schedule, Ms Agnifilo said her client should not have to be shackled while in court, arguing it denied him the presumption of innocence guaranteed to all defendants.  \"He is a model prisoner\" in federal custody, Ms Agnifilo said. But Judge Gregory Carro said court security preferred for Mr Mangione to remain shackled.  Ms Agnifilo also took issue with Mr Mangione remaining in federal custody.  She said the federal jail made it harder for him to meet lawyers to prepare for his court appearances.  Mr Mangione's lawyer also complained that the chief New York City detective on the case and Mayor Eric Adams had spoken to HBO, the US TV network, about evidence that the defendant's legal team had not even seen yet.   During the proceedings, prosecutors went over the mountain of evidence they plan to present at trial, including DNA, police reports and photographs from the scenes of the crime, body camera footage, phone records and other materials. The judge set a deadline of 9 April to submit pre-trial motions.  In addition to the New York cases, Mr Mangione also faces charges of forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, and other counts in Pennsylvania, where authorities arrested him at a McDonald's.  A fundraiser for legal expenses for Mr Mangione - an Ivy League-educated member of a prominent Baltimore family - has raised over half a million dollars since his arrest.  He is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn, the same facility where Sean 'Diddy' Combs is awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "LA mayor sacks fire chief, blaming her for mishandling wildfires",
         "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has sacked the city's fire chief, blaming her for mishandling the response to last month's devastating wildfires.",
         "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has sacked the city's fire chief, blaming her for mishandling the response to last month's devastating wildfires. Bass said Kristin Crowley had failed to warn her about an imminent fire risk. \"We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,\" the mayor also said in a statement.   Bass has appointed Ronnie Villanueva, an LAFD veteran, as interim fire chief. The wildfires claimed 26 lives, destroyed thousands of homes, and displaced over 150,000 residents. The city charter allows the mayor to fire department heads, including the chief, without city council approval.  However, Crowley has 10 days to appeal, and would need a two-thirds council vote (10 members) to overturn Bass's decision. While securing those votes is unlikely, even a failed appeal could politically challenge Bass. The mayor has taken political heat for her response to the historic fires, almost since the moment they broke out while she was out of the country.  Bass had travelled to Ghana in early January, despite the National Weather Service warning of the heightened risk of wildfires and damage from a major windstorm. Crowley and Bass tussled publicly, too, over the response - with Crowley blaming budget cuts for problems with trying to contain the fires, even though the department's operating budget had technically grown. At a press conference on Friday where Bass repeated her belief that Los Angeles was not properly prepared and that residents' lives had been at risk, the mayor said she knew she wanted to fire then-Chief Crowley weeks ago. She said she decided to wait until the city was out of a state of emergency. Calling the firefighters heroic in taking on the Palisades fire, Bass added that \"bringing new leadership to the fire department is what they and the people of Los Angeles deserve\". One of Bass's biggest critics, Rick Caruso, a major force in local business and real estate who ran for mayor, blasted Bass on X for firing Crowley, saying the former chief had spoken \"honestly about the severe and profoundly ill-conceived budget cuts the Bass administration made\" and alleging she had been fired for speaking out. \"The Mayor's decision to ignore the warnings and leave the city was hers alone,\" he also wrote. \"This is a time for city leaders to take responsibility for their actions and their decisions.\" Kristin Crowley made history as the department's first female fire chief when she was appointed in 2022. During her tenure, she prioritized firefighter recruitment, diversity initiatives, and modernizing outdated department policies. However, her leadership faced controversy, particularly regarding staffing shortages during the recent fires. Current and retired LAFD chief officers have accused her of mismanaging the wildfire response, highlighting in a recent letter issues such as inadequate evacuation plans and insufficient firefighting resources. They called for her resignation, saying that \"a large number of Chief Officers do not believe you are up to the task.\" Crowley also faced backlash for her focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the department. Her critics argued that this emphasis diverted attention from essential firefighting operations, potentially compromising the department's effectiveness during crises. LAFD spokesperson Erik Scott said the department was \"aware of the mayor's announcement\" and had \"no further comments or interviews on this matter at this time.\" Bass has called for a full investigation into the wildfires response, and Governor Gavin Newsom has called for a similar investigation at the state level.  Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.

         "Salman Rushdie attacker found guilty of attempted murder and assault",
         "A New Jersey man who stabbed renowned British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage has been convicted of attempted murder and assault.",
         "A New Jersey man who stabbed renowned British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage has been convicted of attempted murder and assault. Hadi Matar, 27, now faces a sentence of more than 30 years in prison. The attack in August 2022 left Sir Salman with severe injuries including damage to his liver, vision loss in one eye and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. The jury's guilty verdict on Friday came after a two-week trial in Chautauqua County Court in western New York state, near the site of the attack. The jury also found Matar guilty of assault for wounding the interviewer, Henry Reese, who was on stage with the author. Mr Reese suffered a minor head injury during the attack. Matar's sentencing date has been scheduled for 23 April. Sir Salman, 77, testified that he was on stage at the historic Chautauqua Institution when he saw a man rushing towards him. Recalling the incident, he said he was struck by the assailant's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\". He initially thought he had been punched, before realising he had been stabbed - 15 times in total - with wounds to his eye, cheek, neck, chest, torso and thigh. The attack took place more than 35 years after Sir Salman's novel, The Satanic Verses, was first published.  The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous. The book  was banned in some countries after it was published in 1988. Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book. But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. During the trial's closing arguments on Friday, prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt played a video in slow-motion of the attack, the Associated Press reports. \"I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack,\" Mr Schmidt said in court, according to the news outlet. \"There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,\" he told the jury. During the two-week trial, defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan argued that prosecutors had failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman. Matar had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers declined to call any witnesses of their own and Matar did not testify in his defence. In an interview with the New York Post from jail in 2022, Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution.  \"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Matar said about the author. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\" He added that he had only read a few pages of the Satanic Verses. Matar, born in Fairview in New Jersey to parents who emigrated from Lebanon, has also been charged in a separate federal case with providing material support to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, according to an indictment unsealed in July. Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

         "Judge pauses NYC mayor Eric Adams trial in corruption case ",
         "A judge paused the trial against New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Friday to gather further arguments, according to a new court order. ",
         "A judge paused the trial against New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Friday to gather further arguments, according to a new court order.  US District Judge Dale Ho has ordered an outside lawyer to get involved in the case and argue whether the charges should be dismissed. Adams is facing fraud, bribery and other charges, but he denies any wrongdoing. Trump administration officials aim to dismiss the case against him, arguing that it has damaged his ability to aid the president's agenda. Adams' trial, scheduled for mid-April, is now off the calendar indefinitely. Long time US Supreme Court lawyer Paul Clement has been tapped as the outside lawyer, with possible oral arguments to begin 14 March. Clement is a former US Solicitor General who served during the George W Bush administration. He has often represented conservative positions at the Supreme Court. Judge Ho wrote in court documents that the appointment of Clement is \"appropriate\" adding, \"particularly so in light of the public importance of this case.\" Before the judge earlier this week, Justice Department lawyers defended their decision to end the criminal case against Adams. Emil Bove, a top official at the department who served as Trump's criminal defence lawyer, instructed federal prosecutors last week to drop the case. Bove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level Justice officials resigned in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the directive. Danielle Sassoon, the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, was the first of the lead prosecutors to resign. In a letter to the US attorney general, she alleged that Adams' lawyers - while meeting with Bove and other prosecutors - \"repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo\" in an effort to dismiss the case. Bove's office later filed a motion to dismiss, prompting the judge to call a hearing. During an interview alongside Trump's border czar Tom Homan last week, Adams denied his side had proposed that the Justice Department drop the case in exchange for immigration measures, a move Sassoon had said amounted to a \"quid pro quo\". Adams said the allegations were \"silly\". Several New York officials in the state and the city have called for Adams to be removed from office or for him to resign.  Despite having the authority, New York Governor Kathy Hochul decided on Thursday not to remove Adams from office. Instead, she announced a plan to limit his authority. The New York governor said she would propose legislation and measures aimed at exerting more oversight over the mayor's office. Adams responded there would have been no legal basis to remove him. Hochul proposed a new inspector general position for New York City, providing more resources for officials to take legal action against the Trump administration, and expanding funding for the state comptroller's office to conduct more oversight of the city. Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (¬£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges. His administration has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even prior to the charges being announced against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been charged as part of the investigation. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

         "Musk wields his Doge chainsaw - but is a backlash brewing? ",
         "Wearing a black \"Make America Great Again\" hat and dark sunglasses, Elon Musk - the multi-billionaire tasked by Donald Trump with taking a metaphorical chainsaw to the federal government - received a rock-star welcome as he took the stage at a right-wing gathering on Thursday.",
         "Wearing a black \"Make America Great Again\" hat and dark sunglasses, Elon Musk - the multi-billionaire tasked by Donald Trump with taking a metaphorical chainsaw to the federal government - received a rock-star welcome as he took the stage at a right-wing gathering on Thursday. He even had a literal chainsaw. As the crowd of several thousand cheered, Argentine President Javier Milei, also a favourite at the annual Cpac event, emerged from backstage. He handed Musk a shiny chainsaw with \"viva la Libertad carajo! ‚Äì Spanish for \"Long live liberty, damn it!\"-  emblazoned on the blade. Musk waved the power tool high, shouting: \"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy! Chainsaw!\" It was a remarkable moment on a day typified by less animated speeches about the dangers of big government and the accomplishments of Trump's first month back in the White House. It demonstrated how Musk is the only conservative who approaches Trump's ability to energise a crowd. Outside of Washington, however, there are signs that Musk's chainsaw approach to federal government ‚Äì which includes shuttering agencies, defunding programmes and mass civil service layoffs ‚Äì may be cutting too close to the bone. At about the same time as Musk was celebrating the work of his so-called \"Department of Government Efficiency\" at the event near Washington DC, Republican congressman Rich McCormick was holding a town hall forum for his constituents. Many in Roswell, Georgia, were angry about the impact of the Musk-inspired cuts and let the congressman know it. \"Congress controls the budget, not the president,\" a woman said. \"You are doing a disservice to set that down and not stand up for us.\" McCormick's response was drowned out by jeers. \"I understand trying to do more with less ‚Äì that's reasonable,\" another constituent said. \"What's not reasonable is taking this chainsaw approach.\" Earlier this month, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans have an unfavourable view of Musk, including 37% that responded \"very unfavourable\". Only 23% of Americans told Reuters-Ipsos pollsters this week that the president has the right to fire \"any federal employee who disagrees with the president\". Fifty-eight percent said they were concerned that popular government programmes, like Social Security retirement benefits for the elderly and subsidised student loans ‚Äì could be affected. Just over half of Americans in a CNN poll said Trump had gone \"too far\" in exercising his presidential power. At an earlier event at Cpac on Thursday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson praised Musk and his team. \"They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been able to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us,\" he said. Many Republicans have agreed with this sentiment, even if it means ceding congressional power over government spending to the president. Congressional conservatives have been trying to downsize the federal government for decades with limited effectiveness ‚Äì and now Musk and Trump are delivering, albeit through a sweeping expansion of executive power. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis told CBS News he believed Doge's approach was necessary because Republicans had failed to get legitimate answers from bureaucrats about how to make government more efficient.  \"And the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,\" Tillis said. \"I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense.\" That may change, however, if Trump's poll numbers ‚Äì which have dipped slightly recently ‚Äì continue to decline and if Republican legislators are challenged by constituents at town hall meetings or have their offices flooded with angry calls. Members of Congress across the US have begun stepping forward to defend federal programmes ‚Äì including funding for academic research, agriculture, veterans services and national parks ‚Äì that have been affected by Musk's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" actions. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama called for a \"smart, targeted approach\" to cuts that could target health research conducted in her home state. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican, complained on social media that many of the proposed layoffs \"will do more harm than good\". \"I share the administration's goal of reducing the size of the federal government,\" she wrote on X, \"but this approach is bringing confusion, anxiety and now trauma to our civil servants.\" The Trump administration has already walked back some of its announced layoffs in key sectors ‚Äì including Department of Energy employees who handle nuclear weapons security, Department of Agriculture teams tasked with containing the recent outbreak of bird flu, and workers in a programme that monitors the health of first responders and survivors of the 11 September World Trade Center attack. \"I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,\" said Susan Collins of Maine, another centrist Republican senator. \"The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach.\" At his appearance last week at the White House, Musk acknowledged that his team might make mistakes in its eagerness to slash government spending ‚Äì \"but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes\", he promised. That may be cold comfort for Americans adversely affected by the Doge chainsaw, however.  And it could come at a political price.  History has shown that even when mistakes are fixed, voters often remember these kind of missteps the next time they head to the polls. He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused. A US bird flu epidemic has resulted in the deaths of tens-of-millions of poultry and strained the country's egg supply. The Trump administration believes the announcement will encourage mass 'self deportations'. It is still several steps from becoming law, but marks a major victory for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The agency known as \"Doge\" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Ten NY prison guards charged in fatal beating of inmate",
         "Ten former New York state prison guards have been charged in connection with the fatal beating of a prison inmate.",
         "Ten former New York state prison guards have been charged in connection with the fatal beating of a prison inmate. Officers were seen on body camera footage hitting Robert Brooks while he sat handcuffed on a medical examination table at the Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024. Brooks died the following day. On Thursday, a grand jury handed down indictments on charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter and tampering with evidence. Of the nine officers who appeared in court on Thursday, all pleaded not guilty. Another is set to appear in court next week, the county district attorney said. Bodycam videos appear to show a prison officer placing something in Brooks's mouth before striking him, and another officer hitting him in the stomach with a shoe. At one point, an officer is seen lifting Brooks by the neck before forcefully putting him on the examination table. A medical examiner ruled Brooks's death a homicide.  A special prosecutor assigned to the case, Onandaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, detailed Brooks's serious injuries on Thursday, including broken bones and cartilage, bruising to his internal organs and repeated restrictions to his airways which caused severe brain damage. Brooks \"did absolutely nothing\" to provoke the assault and ultimately died by choking on his own blood, Fitzpatrick said, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Shortly after the incident, New York Governor Kathy Hochul ordered the firing of 13 officers and a prison nurse who were allegedly involved in the assault. Fitzpatrick said prison officers Anthony Farina, Nicholas Anzalone, David Kingsley, Christopher Walrath and Mathew Galliher were charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. All five pleaded not guilty at arraignments on Thursday. Michael Mashaw, Michael Fisher and David Walters were charged with manslaughter and face a sentence of up to 15 years if convicted, while Nicholas Gentile was charged with tampering with evidence, which is punishable by up to four years behind bars. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges. Another unnamed suspect indicted for second-degree murder will surrender at a later date, Fitzpatrick said, and three others, also unnamed by authorities, have reached plea agreements. The union that represents the officers, New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, said the actions of those involved in the incident were \"incomprehensible and not reflective of the majority of our membership\". In a statement it added: \"The indictments and arrests today of those officers who allegedly were involved in causing Mr. Brooks death, should be afforded the same presumption of innocence that every citizen is afforded until proven guilty in a court of law.\" Several attorneys for the defendants declined to comment on the case Friday, and the BBC attempted to contact legal representatives for the other officers. The investigation into Brooks's death continues. At the time of his death, Brooks, 43, had served nine years of a 12-year prison sentence for stabbing his son's mother. He had been transferred to the Marcy prison, about 220 miles (350km) north of New York City, from a nearby facility just hours before the beating. Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents. The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.  The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. The government wants to adopt a scheme which encourages inmates to gain qualifications and take jobs. Copyright 2025 BBC.

         "Farmers say bird flu a 'crisis' as egg prices soar",
         "For Brian Kreher, a fourth-generation farmer in the small town of Clarence, New York, the latest outbreak of bird flu has meant many sleepless nights.",
         "For Brian Kreher, a fourth-generation farmer in the small town of Clarence, New York, the latest outbreak of bird flu has meant many sleepless nights. He considers his 18-acre farm one of the lucky ones. With extensive safety precautions, he hasn't lost any birds to the virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across the US. But the outbreak forced him to make tough calls, like deciding whether to accept a new batch of baby chicks from a hatchery near a virus hotspot in Pennsylvania. If he didn't, he would have no chickens to replace those that die or get sick. \"I had no choice,\" Kreher told the BBC. \"It was either accept those baby chicks, or over the next year, we slowly exit farming.\" \"Egg farmers are in the fight of our lives and we are losing,\" he said. Though the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing over 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing. The virus then got a foothold among dairy cows last year, and this month, a different strain - tied to severe infections in humans - was found in the cattle. The worsening outbreak comes as President Donald Trump's new administration makes sweeping cuts to government staffing and research funding that public health experts say threatens the country's ability to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemics. This week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told the BBC it fired several officials who were working on the response to bird flu before trying to hire them back days later. The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses. \"Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly,\" said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential.\" Trump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease. When asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had \"crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty\", inflation and \"radical environmental policies\". Scientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Influenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said. Bird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals. Then, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus. The new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds. \"We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads,\" Mr Pekosz said. The virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen. Mr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country. Bird flu \"is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes\", he said. \"We need new strategies to fight this virus.\" California poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border. \"It was extremely painful,\" said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association. In response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus \"with biosecurity and medication\". \"Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week,\" Hassett said. Mr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed. \"What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked,\" he said. \"We're in a crisis.\" Vaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis. Still, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council. Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts. But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials. \"I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously,\" Mr Pekosz said. Ms Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office. At the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1. \"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get,\" she said. Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis. But, she said, the threat is one Trump officials should take seriously. \"We don't know if this could be an emergency for humans next week, or if it could be several months from now, or if it might not happen at all,\" Ms Simoneau said. \"But taking your eye off the ball isn't really an option.\" No 10 thinks the talks were a success but questions remain on defence, our political editor writes. The attorney general is accusing federal agents in New York of withholding documents related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The release of Tate and his brother came after discussions between US and Romanian officials.  The US leader plays down earlier frictions and predicts a \"very good meeting\" on Friday. The US president is invited to a royal estate in Scotland to discuss the logistics of a second state visit. Copyright 2025 BBC.
