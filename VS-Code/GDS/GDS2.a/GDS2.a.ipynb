Specifically, you'll focus on extracting information from news websites, a vital step in creating a dataset for training a fake news detection model. In terms of the Data Science Pipeline, you will mainly focusing on acquiring raw data, processing data, cleaning and explorative data analysis, and structured representation and storage of data."
