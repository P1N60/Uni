       "['Greeks are holding their biggest protests for years and taking part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured. \"I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice,\" said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens. It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece. An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing. The report by Greece\\'s Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. \"Those children were killed because the train was not safe,\" said the authority\\'s chief Christos Papadimitriou. The Tempi disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials. The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives. By early afternoon, tempers flared and clashes broke out with police. Petrol bombs were thrown and police used tear gas. Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read \"I have no oxygen - justice to the end\", referring to the 57 who died. Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK. The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa.  Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train. In Athens, protesters held placards reading \"My child, call me when you arrive\" and \"No cover-up\".  What happened at the Tempi rail disaster? Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. \"I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident\", she told BBC. \"We demand that all the evidence come to light.\" Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work. Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square. Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge. In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone\\'s thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night. \"Nothing will ever be the same any more,\" he added, speaking of \"fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state\". In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move \"more dynamically and quickly\" to bring about modern and safe trains. For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances. Thursday\\'s inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy. Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring.  \"It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel,\" the report found. \"Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed,\" experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up. Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report. Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and \"landfill\" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene. As he stood in the midst of Friday\\'s protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident. \"I don\\'t know how I find the strength to stand,\" he told BBC.  \"My son gives me the strength. Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t be here today demanding justice.\" Hundreds are thought to have died when the Adriana sank in international waters two years ago.   The Greek island\\'s most important industry will bounce back, but staffing is a worry say hoteliers Three more quakes above 4.0 magnitude are registered on Monday near the Greek tourist hotspot. Many started evacuating the island as it was hit by tremors - but some have decided to stay.  The island has experienced thousands of quakes in the past week, forcing evacuations of residents.

       " 'Romania\\'s Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday. The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to \"conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially\". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair\\'s US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking.  On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to \"immediately request Tate\\'s extradition from the US to the UK to face justice\". They said in a joint statement that if it did not, \"it won\\'t just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence\". They added: \"We do not doubt the home secretary\\'s personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words.\" The brothers\\' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release. Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania.  She told the BBC Andrew Tate was \"technically correct\" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge. In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form.  In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live. \"It\\'s actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them,\" Ms Tabusca explained.  \"A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government\\xa0would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there.\" Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. \"There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation,\" Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania. Calls for a public explanation of why their travel ban was lifted comes as many Romanians express concern that there appears to be one law for the rich and influential, and another for ordinary citizens. The two flew in a private jet from Romania to Fort Lauderdale in Florida. The 38-year-old former kickboxer once said women should \"bear responsibility\" for sexual assault. Brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate arrive in the US from Romania after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted.

       " 'Ukraine\\'s President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals. Zelensky said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US \"will lead to further deals\", but confirmed no American security guarantees have been agreed yet. Trump said a deal would help American taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war but said the responsibility of Kyiv\\'s security should fall to Europe. On Wednesday Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning. The preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine\\'s reconstruction.  Shmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\". According to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\". Meanwhile the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\". Zelensky has acknowledged the fund but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\".  The agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law.  Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what was seen as a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks. The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (£395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped. \"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine\\'s sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC.  \"Now, they\\'ve shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\" On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (£237bn) and $350bn (£276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal.  But German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine. Zelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US. But on Wednesday, Ukraine\\'s leader said no such guarantee had been made.  \"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it\\'s important that it\\'s there,\" he said.  Asked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar. \"If we don\\'t get security guarantees, we won\\'t have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\" Despite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine\\'s efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\". He said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee. Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying responsibility for this fell to Europe.  But he added that the presence of American workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\". The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine. Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\".  The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia\\'s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option. Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement. Zelensky said he would be \"very direct\" with Trump by asking whether the US would continue supporting Ukraine or not. Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Zelensky in Washington on Friday to sign the agreement. However, Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was being signed in Washington. He said that Zelensky envisaged three separate components to the deal – a procedure for investments and their distribution; how profits would be shared out and a procedure for doing so; and security guarantees for Ukraine. All these would have to be worked out in additional agreements, Podolyak added. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world\\'s \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine. This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles. Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world\\'s rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed. Also, some of the country\\'s mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine\\'s economy minister, resources worth $350bn (£277bn) remain in occupied territories today. There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine\\'s vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.  A quarter of Ukraine\\'s landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country. Another issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal. \"These resources aren\\'t in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\" Vladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed. But on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia\\'s \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago. Putin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\". \"As for the new territories, it\\'s the same.

       " 'Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdish group PKK, has called on his movement to lay down its arms and dissolve itself. His statement, read out in a letter by MPs from a pro-Kurdish party, was aimed at ending four decades of armed struggle in south-eastern Turkey in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. Ocalan, 75, had earlier met the MPs for several hours on Imrali, an island in the Sea of Marmara south-west of Istanbul where he has been imprisoned in solitary confinement since 1999. His announcement came months after ultra-nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli, who is an ally of Turkey\\'s government, launched an initiative to bring an end to the conflict. \"There is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realisation of a political system,\" Ocalan\\'s letter read. \"Democratic consensus is the fundamental way.\" The letter was read out by Dem party members Ahmet Turk and Pervin Buldan in both Kurdish and Turkish at a hotel in Istanbul, after their third visit to Imrali island in recent months. Appealing to members of the PKK - the Kurdistan Workers\\' Party - Ocalan said \"all groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself\". He said the movement - banned as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US - was formed primarily because \"the channels of democratic politics were closed\".  However, Devlet Bahceli, backed by positive signals from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other political parties, had created the right environment for the PKK to lay down its arms, he added. Bahceli has for years pushed for tough military action against the PKK, but last October he surprised colleagues by shaking hands with MPs from the Dem party in parliament. He then suggested Ocalan could be given parole if he gave up violence and dissolved his armed group. There was cautious optimism from some quarters that the 40-year conflict would come to an end.  \"We\\'ll look at the outcome,\" said a leading member of Erdogan\\'s ruling AKP, Efkan Ala. The biggest opposition party, the secular CHP, said it would convene a meeting on Thursday evening. Pervin Buldan and Dem party colleague Sirri Sureyya Onder had already met Ocalan twice in recent weeks, and they have briefed other parties on their visits. Onder told an audience made up largely of Kurdish politicians and journalists that they were at a positive turning point in history. Kurdish leaders largely welcomed the statement and local reports said thousands of people gathered to watch the statement on big screens in the cities of Diyarbakir and Van in the predominantly Kurdish south-east. Read: Who are the Kurds?  However, significant questions remain among both the Kurdish and Turkish public over what the next step might be. Not everyone was convinced things would change. Last week a senior PKK commander, Duran Kalkan, warned that the ruling AKP was not looking for a solution but to \"take over, destroy and annihilate\". Kurdish politicians and journalists had faced a crackdown and the Turkish army was engaged in military operations in Iraqi Kurdistan and north-eastern Syria, he added. \"[Erdogan} is provoking and instigating war like a \\'war baron\\',\" he told a pro-PKK TV channel. Turkish-backed forces in northeastern Syria have intensified their campaign against Kurdish forces and last month called on Syria\\'s new leaders to eliminate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Pro-Kurdish politicians have been targeted by a wave of arrests and jail sentences in recent years.  Last year the two leaders of the pro-Kurdish HDP, Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, were imprisoned for 42 years and 30 years respectively over deadly riots in 2014. They had already been in prison since 2016. Kurdish politicians said it was a \"black stain\" on Turkey\\'s justice system and the HDP was subsequently reformed as the Dem party. Some 40,000 people have died since the PKK\\'s insurgency began. There was a spike in violence in southeastern Turkey from 2015-17 when a two-and-a-half year ceasefire broke down. More recently, in October the PKK claimed an attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) headquarters near Ankara which left five people dead.  While Ocalan\\'s letter was being read out, the opposition Good party hung a large black banner on its headquarters remembering victims of the PKK: \"We will not forget, we will not let them be forgotten.\" Kurdish House community association volunteers aim to collect 5,000 bags of rubbish in six months. Members of the Kurdish community clashed with police following the arrests across London in November. The 45-year-old is suspected of controlling a network of people smugglers in Europe and the Middle East. A Kurdish-led force blamed Iran-backed militias for the strike on a training centre in Deir al-Zour. From the Red Sea to Gaza to Iran, the past week has deepened fears of conflict spreading.

       " 'The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen said EU and India were pushing to get a free trade agreement during this year. \"I am well aware it will not be easy. But I also know that timing and determination counts,\" von der Leyen said in Delhi, adding that such an agreement would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world.  The EU Commission chief is in India accompanied by the entire College of Commissioners -  the first such visit after the European parliamentary elections in June 2024.  She met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.  Speaking in the Indian capital, she said the two sides wanted to deepen trade and investment collaboration in wide ranging areas like semiconductors, AI and cleantech.  India and EU relaunched talks on a long pending free trade agreement in 2021 and are set to hold another round in March. An India-EU summit is also being held later in the year.  Von der Leyen also said that India and EU were pushing for renewed cooperation in security and stability and were exploring a future \\'Security and Defence Partnership\\' with India similar to the partnerships with Japan and South Korea. Brussels is keen to expand its relationships in the Indo-Pacific as cracks deepen between the US and Europe over trade tariffs and Ukraine following Donald Trump\\'s return to the White House. Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the US\". The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\". Given the backdrop, analysts say strong trade and security relations with India have become more important than ever for the EU. A trade deal has proven difficult so far due to differences in areas like agriculture and manufacturing.  Despite renewed negotiations \"the two sides have little to show for the talks thus far\", Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank, said in a note. However, some 6,000 EU companies operate in India and the bloc is India\\'s largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade reaching $135bn (£107bn) in 2022-23, nearly doubling in the last decade. After years of scepticism about free trade deals, India is now actively signing agreements and negotiating with multiple countries and blocs. India and the UK restarted free trade talks this week, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Last year, India signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.

       " 'Romania\\'s Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday. The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to \"conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially\". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair\\'s US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking.  On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to \"immediately request Tate\\'s extradition from the US to the UK to face justice\". They said in a joint statement that if it did not, \"it won\\'t just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence\". They added: \"We do not doubt the home secretary\\'s personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words.\" The brothers\\' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release. Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania.  She told the BBC Andrew Tate was \"technically correct\" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge. In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form.  In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live. \"It\\'s actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them,\" Ms Tabusca explained.  \"A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government\\xa0would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there.\" Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. \"There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation,\" Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania.

       " 'At least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union\\'s law enforcement organisation Europol has said. The suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency. The operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material (CSAM), Europol said. The lack of national legislation against these crimes made it \"exceptionally challenging for investigators\", it added. Arrests were made simultaneously on Wednesday 26 February during Operation Cumberland, led by Danish law enforcement, a statement said. Authorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved and the operation is still continuing, with more arrests expected in the next few weeks, Europol said. In addition to the arrests, so far 272 suspects have been identified, 33 house searches have been conducted and 173 electronic devices have been seized, according to the agency.  It also said the main suspect was a Danish national who was arrested in November 2024. The statement said he \"ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced\".  After making a \"symbolic online payment\", users from around the world were able to get a password that allowed them to \"access the platform and watch children being abused\".  The agency said online child sexual exploitation was one of the top priorities for the European Union\\'s law enforcement organisations, which were dealing with \"an ever-growing volume of illegal content\". Europol added that even in cases when the content was fully artificial and there was no real victim depicted, such as with Operation Cumberland, \"AI-generated CSAM still contributes to the objectification and sexualisation of children\". Europol\\'s executive director Catherine De Bolle said: \"These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge.\" She warned law enforcement would need to develop \"new investigative methods and tools\" to address the emerging challenges. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced and becoming more prevalent on the open web. In research last year the charity found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%. Experts say AI child sexual abuse material can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake. Copyright 2025 BBC.

       " 'Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for two weeks, is showing signs of improvement, the Vatican has said in a medical update. He will remain in hospital due to a complex clinical picture, the Vatican said on Friday morning. It added the 88-year-old had another \"peaceful night\" and is \"now resting\" in Rome\\'s Gemelli Hospital. Italian news agency Ansa reported that the pontiff was now out of the \"critical phase\", citing Vatican sources. The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Then, on 22 February, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a \"critical\" condition, but later on Sunday released an update saying that he had \"not presented any further respiratory crises\". The following day, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. But, while the Vatican said the Pope\\'s health is improving, it added that \"further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis\". The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023. From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church. The Reverend Canon Dave Bull is consecrated as the new Bishop of Buckingham. Founders of a new Blackburn mosque says support from the community has been \"overwhelming\".  The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, Martin Seeley, says retirement feels \"really strange\". The latest statement suggests that the 88-year-old is able to sit in his chair, eat normally and do what the Vatican calls \"light work\".  Around the world, prayers and services are being held in support of the pontiff. Copyright 2025 BBC.

The leader of the Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPÖ), Herbert Kickl, called the tie-up a coalition of \"losers\" and called for a snap election. Thursday\\'s announcement follows the longest period of coalition negotiations in Austria\\'s recent history, after two previous attempts to form a government failed. The three-party government, which would be the first since the late 1940s, is due to take office next week, if all the parties approve the deal. The biggest hurdle is a vote at a Neos party meeting on Sunday, where a two-thirds majority is needed. The new chancellor will be Christian Stocker of the ÖVP. As he presented the new government programme with the leader of the SPÖ, Andreas Babler, and the Neos, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Stocker said the negotiations had been \"perhaps the most difficult in the history of our country\". But he said they had achieved \"a breakthrough\" that wasn\\'t \"a minimal compromise\". The three parties set out plans to avoid facing a European Union procedure for running an excess budget deficit, with measures including an increased levy on banks. The programme also includes tougher asylum measures, including a temporary stop for family reunifications. Stocker said there would be \"an integration year for refugees\" from day one of their arrival in Austria. The three parties also said they reserved the right to impose an asylum freeze, if numbers of applications increased. They are also planning a headscarf ban for girls under 15. The programme also emphasised that the government was \"committed to a strong and better European Union\". In a post on social media, Kickl said: \"I don\\'t think this has ever happened before: a so-called \\'government programme\\' before a government has even been formed.\" Despite the FPÖ\\'s unprecedented victory, topping the polls for the first time, Austria\\'s President Alexander Van der Bellen first gave the ÖVP the mandate to form a government. At the time, the leaders of all of the other parties ruled out making an alliance with Herbert Kickl. However, the ÖVP\\'s first attempt to forge a coalition with the Social Democrats and Neos failed at the beginning of January. On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government. But a few weeks later, the Freedom Party\\'s talks with the conservatives also broke down, partly due to disputes over minister posts. Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there had been \"no base of trust\" between the two parties. The ÖVP, the Social Democrats and Neos then started a second round of negotiations, which culminated in an agreement. Thomas Hofer says their new alliance faces challenges. \"This is of course an emergency cabinet. It had to be built quickly and one can see that looking at the programme, The main message is that they are not Herbert Kickl, but that message will not last very long. They will have to negotiate more along the way.\" Hofer says the parties \"even have to guarantee inner party stability\", and that their popularity could grow if they tackle \"the massive problems ahead, but those problems are also a chance for the FPÖ\", which he said had  flourished in opposition. According to opinion polls, a new election would see further gains for the Freedom Party. A 14-year-old boy was killed and five others were wounded in the attack  in Villach. The suspect, who is a Syrian asylum seeker, was detained at the scene and is being questioned by police. The far-right Freedom Party quits coalition talks, fuelling uncertainty. Police said they discovered cash, jewellery and gold worth over 10m euros at the woman\\'s house near Vienna. The woman has lived in Niger for over two decades and is a fixture in her community, reports say. Copyright 2025 BBC.

       " 'Thirty-two people were deported from the Republic of Ireland to Georgia on a chartered flight on Thursday night. It was the first operation conducted under a contract signed by the Republic last November for the provision of charter flights for deportations. All of those taken to Tbilisi on the flight were Georgian nationals who had been subject to deportation orders. The group was made up of 28 men, three women and a child who was with their parents. \"A central priority for me and this government is that our immigration laws are robust and enforced,\" Irish Justice Minister Jim O\\'Callaghan said. \"People are entitled to have confidence in our immigration system and there must be consequences for individuals who refuse to leave the state when they are ordered to do so.\" He said Thursday\\'s flight was \"a significant start in ensuring that deportation orders are enforced and part of a more effective immigration system generally.  \"There will be further flights scheduled in the future.\" Gardai (police), medical staff, an interpreter and a human rights observer were also onboard the flight. Mr O\\'Callaghan said when a person\\'s application for asylum is refused or they are found to have no permission to be in the state, they are offered assistance to return home voluntarily.  If they do not do so, they are liable to be deported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, he added. The Irish Department of Justice said access to chartered flights \"has significantly increased the capacity of An Garda Síochána to effect removals\". Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: \"Yesterday, the Garda National Immigration Bureau of An Garda Síochána, in a planned operation, carried out the removal of 32 persons from Ireland to Georgia.  \"This was the largest removal operation carried out by GNIB in over six years. A \"An Garda Síochána continues to play its role in enforcing immigration legislation and maintaining the security and integrity of our borders.\" Minister of State for Migration Colm Brophy said: \"Chartered deportation flights will now form an important part of removing people who do not have a right to remain in our country.  \"I look forward to now seeing chartered flights in conjunction with voluntary deportations, ensuring that we will have a firm and effective system in place to deal with deportations going forward.\" The former home secretary launches a petition to stop government plans for Wates House in Fareham.

       " 'North Korea has sent more soldiers to Russia and re-deployed others to the frontline in the western Kursk region, according to South Korea\\'s intelligence agency.  It said the exact number of extra troops sent was unknown, but military officials quoted in South Korean media have said they believed it was at least 1,000.  Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang have confirmed the new deployment. North Korea is thought to have suffered heavy losses in the four months since its troops were first deployed to help Russia in its war with Ukraine.  In January, Western officials told the BBC they believed at least 1,000 of the 11,000 troops sent from North Korea had been killed in the past three months. North Korea and Russia did not comment.  The South Korean intelligence agency also said on Thursday that North Korean troops already in Russia had been re-deployed to the front line in Kursk at the start of February \"after about a month of lull\".  Ukrainian special forces fighting in Kursk told the BBC in January that they had not seen any North Korean troops for weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later confirmed they had returned to the front line.  Earlier reports attributed to South Korean intelligence suggested that the North Korean soldiers were unprepared for modern warfare, and were especially vulnerable to Ukrainian drones. However, defectors and other military experts have told the BBC these troops should not be underestimated. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The fighting has led to heavy losses on both sides. Last August, Ukraine made a lightning thrust into the Russian Kursk region, taking border guards by surprise. Russia has been trying to drive them out ever since.  While Ukraine\\'s gains have since been steadily pushed back, partly due to the arrival of the North Koreans in Russia in October, it still retains hundreds of square kilometres of Russian territory and is inflicting huge losses on its enemy. Russia\\'s military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed. Zelensky has put Ukraine\\'s military casualties at 45,100 - but a number of military experts in both Ukraine and the West believe the losses are much higher. Reports began emerging that North Korean soldiers had been deployed in October, following the deepening of bilateral ties between Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. This included the signing a security and defence treaty. Donald Trump will not get involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, but can Europe fill the gap?

       " 'British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban. Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are \"misunderstood\". Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain \"under judicial control\" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania. However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.  In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them. Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: \"We live in a democratic society where it\\'s innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood.\" \"There\\'s a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,\" he said, adding that they are \"yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever\". The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump\\'s role in them being allowed into the US. A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.  \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,\" Mr McBride said in a statement.  Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: \"I know nothing about that. I don\\'t know, you\\'re saying he\\'s on a plane right now?\" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: \"There\\'s an English element here, so obviously it\\'s important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk.\" On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft. Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month. The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother\\'s role in persuading \"millions of young men\" to back him \"cannot be overlooked\". Romania\\'s Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump\\'s envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago. Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach \"a form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his \"publicly available tweets\". However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views. He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking. They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny. A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion. In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him. Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action. \"We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,\" the women said in a statement. Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May\\'s elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania\\'s organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave. \"I am outraged!\" she wrote on social media, \"as a woman, a human being and a Romanian.\" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure. Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed. Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith \"may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty\", it said in a statement in Romanian. Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts. This comes after court limitations were \"modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,\" the statement from the Tates\\' representative said. The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors\\' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them. Romania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance\\'s eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US. Senior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December\\'s presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia. Georgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted \"incitement to acts against the constitutional order\". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a \"formalised coup d\\'etat\". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud. The two flew in a private jet from Romania to Fort Lauderdale in Florida. The 38-year-old former kickboxer once said women should \"bear responsibility\" for sexual assault. Brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate arrive in the US from Romania after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted. Prosecutors are investigating a series of alleged offences, after Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round. Charity says German Shepherd has spent her whole life chained to a tree.

       " 'Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country\\'s mineral resources, Trump has said.  Zelensky has described the bilateral deal as preliminary, and said he wants further agreements which include US security guarantees to deter renewed Russian aggression.  But Trump said the US would not provide guarantees \"beyond... very much\", saying the responsibility should instead fall to Europe. Trump also seemingly ruled out the prospect of Ukraine becoming a Nato member - one of Zelensky\\'s long-held ambitions.  Speaking at a meeting of his cabinet on Wednesday, Trump said the presence of American workers extracting rare earth metals on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\" for Ukraine.  He said Kyiv should \"forget about\" joining Nato and repeated Russia\\'s claims that the issue was one of the driving factors behind the war.  The US president suggested a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia was not far off, telling reporters: \"We\\'re going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.\" But Zelensky said without security guarantees \"we won\\'t have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing\".  \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar,\" he said.  Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. In 2008, the alliance had said that Ukraine could eventually join. Trump has suggested European peacekeeping troops could be stationed in Ukraine as part of a ceasefire deal, but Russia says it is against this.  European representatives, however, were not included in Washington\\'s initial talks with Russia. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said \"for any kind of deal to work on European soil, you need the Europeans to also agree to it\". She said the mineral resources deal was up to Ukraine, but any peace agreement would \"need the Europeans on board\". Ms Kallas\\' scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday was abruptly cancelled, with both sides citing scheduling issues. Zelensky said the success of the minerals deal, which was formally backed by his government on Wednesday evening, would depend on the outcome of his meeting with Trump this week. Key details have not yet been made public, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said it envisages an \"investment fund\" for Ukraine\\'s reconstruction. The prospect of a deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine. But disagreements over its substance exacerbated tensions between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.  The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (£395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports suggest this demand has now been dropped. There are also differences in how both sides are now describing the deal. Trump has lauded the \"very big agreement\" as an opportunity for the US to get its \"money back\" after funding aid to Ukraine.  But Zelensky has instead referred to it as a \"framework agreement\" upon which he hopes further deals can be made. Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine.  In response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin \"break out of years of isolation\" and Trump of living in a \"Russian disinformation space\".  Ukraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world\\'s \"critical raw materials\" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward.  Some of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine\\'s economy minister, resources worth $350bn (£277bn) remain in occupied territories today. There are warnings too that Ukraine first needs to addresses its problem with unexploded mines before striking a deal with the US. A quarter of Ukraine\\'s landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country. Putin has also said he is open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied Ukraine. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also be meeting both Trump and Zelensky separately this week to discuss the war in Ukraine. He is due to arrive in Washington later on Wednesday. US police say a rapper\\'s \"cowardly\" actions in a \"rival gang stronghold\" led to a spate of violence. The United States has never had an official language since it was founded nearly 250 years ago. Donald Trump will not get involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, but can Europe fill the gap? The US government axes vital HIV/Aids funding, with warnings it could lead to half a million deaths.

       " 'Volodymyr Zelensky is in Washington for discussions with Donald Trump on how to end the war with Russia. The Ukrainian leader is expected to sign a deal that could see his country provide America with rare earth minerals in return for an \"investment fund\" for Ukraine\\'s reconstruction. The pair have traded barbs in the past but their relationship appeared to worsen after Zelensky said Trump was in a \"disinformation space\" and Trump called Zelensky a \"dictator\" - although the US leader backtracked on that comment on Thursday. Here is a look back at what the two have said to, and about, one another, and how their public relationship has developed over the years. 21 April 2019: On the day Zelensky is elected president of Ukraine, Trump, still in his first term, calls Zelensky to congratulate him. Trump says it was an \"incredible election\" and adds that \"you will do a great job\". 2019: Allies of Trump begin stoking allegations that Joe Biden, then Democratic frontrunner for president, lobbied Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor to stymie an investigation into energy firm Burisma, of which his son, Hunter, sat on the board. The allegations were later found to be fabricated, and the prosecutor was removed from office for corruption. 25 July 2019: In a phone conversation that would become the basis for Trump\\'s first impeachment, Trump asks Zelensky to \"get to the bottom\" of the allegations. Zelensky says the evidence would reviewed later that year. 29 September 2020: In the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden, Trump alludes to the allegations, saying: \"Once you became vice-president, [Hunter] made a fortune in Ukraine and China and Moscow and various other places.\" 24 February 2022: Russia begins its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which Trump describes as \"appalling\". He adds that Zelensky is \"brave\" for remaining in Kyiv, and claims the invasion \"would never have happened\" if he had been elected in 2020. 5 March 2023: \"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Trump tells a conservative conference. \"And it will take me no longer than one day.\" May 2024: Zelensky\\'s term expires but he remains in office, as scheduled elections in Ukraine do not go ahead because the nation remains under martial law. He previously said that \"now is not the time for elections\". 22 September 2024: Zelensky tells the New Yorker magazine: \"My feeling is that Trump doesn\\'t really know how to stop the war, even if he might think he knows how.\" He adds that \"many\" leaders have thought they could, but have been unable to. 25 September 2024: On the campaign trail, Trump accuses Zelensky of \"making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president, me\", adding: \"Any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.\" 27 September 2024: Zelensky and Trump meet in New York. Zelensky says they have a \"common view that the war has to be stopped and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin can\\'t win\", while Trump says he will resolve the war \"very quickly\". 6 November 2024: Trump is re-elected US president. Zelensky is among the first world leaders to call to congratulate him, writing shortly after that he looked forward to a \"strong\" US under Trump\\'s \"decisive leadership\". 22 January 2025: \"It\\'s time to MAKE A DEAL,\" Trump writes on Truth Social. \"We can do it the easy way or the hard way.\" He adds that without a deal, he will be forced to place further economic restrictions on Russia. 23 January 2025: Trump tells the World Economic Forum that Zelensky \"wants to make a deal\" but Putin \"might not\". 15 February 2025: Zelensky writes that he has begun working with Trump\\'s team, adding: \"The world is looking up to America as the power that has the ability to not only stop the war but also help ensure the reliability of peace afterward.\" 18 February 2025: US-Russia talks about ending the war begin in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zelensky tells reporters that the talks took place \"behind Ukraine\\'s back\", adding: \"Once again, decisions about Ukraine are being made without Ukraine.\" 18 February 2025: After the talks, Trump says he was \"disappointed\" by Ukraine\\'s reaction and appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war, adding that the country \"could have made a deal\" earlier.  19 February 2025: Zelensky says the US president is caught in a Russian \"disinformation space\". He adds: \"We are standing strong on our own two feet. I am counting on... the unity of Europe and the pragmatism of America.\" 19 February 2025: Trump accuses Zelensky of talking the US into spending $350bn (£277bn), and of claiming that half of that money was now missing. Trump calls Zelensky a \"dictator\" who has \"done a terrible job\". 23 February 2025: Zelensky tells a forum that he isn\\'t offended by Trump calling him a \"dictator\". He says: \"If I were a dictator, I\\'d be offended. But I take it. Well, okay, good.\" 25 February 2025: Ukraine\\'s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says a major minerals deal with the US has been agreed. The same day, Trump says he is expecting Zelensky in Washington to sign the deal later that week. 26 February 2025: At a cabinet meeting, Trump says the presence of US workers extracting rare earth metals in Ukraine would provide \"automatic security\". Zelensky says the success of the deal, formally backed by his government that evening, would depend on the outcome of his meeting with Trump.  27 February 2025: Asked by the BBC whether he sticks by his claim that Zelensky is a \"dictator\", Trump replies: \"Did I say that? I can\\'t believe I said that. Next question.\" He also calls Zelensky \"very brave\". 27 February 2025: After Trump\\'s talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the White House, the US president tells reporters he predicts a \"very good meeting\" with Zelensky on Friday.  28 February 2025: Zelenksy arrives in Washington to discuss an agreement on sharing Ukraine\\'s mineral resources.

       " 'Controversial influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have landed in the US after leaving Romania, where they are facing charges including human trafficking, which they deny. Questions remain about why they were allowed to travel and what happens next with their legal cases. Andrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire. Their online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women. The pair have an American father who worked for the US Air Force in Britain. Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US. After their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers. Police in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls. The brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK. The brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation. Speculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media. They left from a Bucharest airport at around 03:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on a private jet bound for Florida, sources have told the BBC. Prosecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair\\'s US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania.  The Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right. Earlier in February, some of Andrew Tate\\'s alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed. It came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania\\'s Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference. Hurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell\\'s approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident. The Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while his close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate\\'s account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022. Andrew and Tristan Tate have not yet commented on their trip to the US, and neither has the Trump administration. The cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March. The pair\\'s request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected. The brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases. They are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges. They face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. Last year, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concludes. A separate, civil case has been opened against the Tates in the US. Separately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\". A representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\". A separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders. The brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said. A Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said. The assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers\\' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac. Some of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\" Four women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate have said they are in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by news of him leaving Romania. In a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\" They also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\". Matthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK. He added he didn\\'t think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\". US police say a rapper\\'s \"cowardly\" actions in a \"rival gang stronghold\" led to a spate of violence.

       " 'Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash. Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed. The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.  Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.  It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally. \"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Università Roma Tre told BBC News. \"This is a unique finding,\" he said. The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum. The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size. The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found. Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths. A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area. Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man\\'s brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough. The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.  For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.  Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings. The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly. No other parts of the man\\'s body are believed to have turned to glass.  Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified. Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass. The scientists believe the skull gave some protection to the brain. The research is published in the scientific journal - a publication where researchers report their work to other experts - Scientific Reports. The best chance to see as many as possible will be after sunset on Wednesday and Thursday.  The environment secretary is met with blaring tractor horns as he tries to win over farmers.

       " 'Leaked audio instructions by Greek rescue co-ordinators have cast further doubt on Greece\\'s official version of events in the hours before a migrant boat sank along with up to 650 people onboard. The Adriana went down in the early hours of 14 June 2023 in international waters – but within Greece\\'s rescue zone - after leaving Libya days earlier. Survivors later told the BBC that coastguards had caused their overcrowded fishing boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent.  The Greek coastguard denied these claims and maintains it did not try to rescue those onboard because they were not in danger and said they had voluntarily wanted to reach Italy, not Greece. But in a phone call that\\'s now emerged an unnamed man speaking from inside a Greek rescue coordination centre is heard instructing the captain of the migrant boat to tell an approaching ship that those onboard do not want to reach Greece. The coastguard has not commented on the audio but said it had handed over all available evidence to a Naval Court which is investigating the disaster. The sinking was one of the worst-ever disasters known to have happened in the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off from the port of Tobruk in Libya nearly a week earlier. Eighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died. Audio recordings obtained by Greek website News247.gr reveal phone calls involving the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the port of Piraeus, near the capital Athens. In the first call, at 18:50 local time (15:50 GMT)  on 13 June, an officer is heard explaining to the man piloting the migrant boat that a large red vessel will soon be approaching to give supplies and that he should explain that the migrants do not want to reach Greece. Officer 1: The replies of the man captaining the migrant boat are not heard. In a second call, 90 minutes later, at 22:10, a seemingly different officer from the same coordination centre, speaks to the captain of the Lucky Sailor (the \"big red ship\"). Officer 2: OK, captain, sorry before I couldn\\'t hear you. I couldn\\'t understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don\\'t want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don\\'t want anything else? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone \"Greece or Italia?\" and everybody there screaming Italia. Officer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don\\'t want Greece and they want Italy? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes. Officer 2: OK Lucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck. Officer 2: OK, captain. So you have finished with the supplies? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, sir, yes. Officer 2: Captain, I want this, I want this to write it in your logbook. The bridge logbook. Lucky Sailor captain: Yes OK, we will write it. Officer 2: OK? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes Officer 2: I want you to write it about that they don\\'t want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy. They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy. Lucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes. Another vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged. The Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted \"all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events\" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor\\'s Office, which is investigating. It said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally. Our BBC investigation in the immediate days after the sinking challenged the Greek authorities\\' explanation for the disaster. Analysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized. The coastguard has always insisted that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue. Last year, a Greek court threw out charges against nine Egyptian men who were accused of causing the shipwreck.  The judges in the southern port city of Kalamata ruled they did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, on the grounds the vessel sank in international waters. Listen: Surviving Greece\\'s migrant boat disaster The indictment had showed that the defendants were being prosecuted on evidence that had already been contradicted by at least six survivors, who told the BBC the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians. Human rights lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, who represented some of the accused Egyptians said he was not surprised by what these recordings. \"We know about the coastguard\\'s tactics of either pushing back or not rescuing people.\" He claimed there had been \"an attempted cover up from day one.\" \"They [Greek authorities] told the story \\'they did not want to be rescued\\' and so have insulted the memory of so many dead people,\" he told the BBC. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and have called for an international investigation. The Greek Ombudsman - an independent authority removed from the government - has been looking at the allegations. The disaster is also being examined by the Greek Naval Court. The number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has led the government to promise action.

       " 'Almost 2,000 motorists in the Republic of Ireland are to have speeding fines and penalty points quashed. The decision has been taken because the speeding was detected by an uncertified speed camera. Some 1,871 drivers were caught speeding on the N17 in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland between 20 December 2024 and 12 February 2025. They were all issued with fixed charge notices. The speeding was detected by a static speed safety camera system, and it is standard procedure for all cameras used for speeding detection to have valid calibration certificates issued by the GoSafe camera provider. Gardaí (Irish police) have explained that in conjunction with GoSafe they discovered that the camera, located near the town of Claremorris, was fully functional and accurately identifying offences, but it was not certified. This discovery was made on 12 February and the decision to quash fines and points was announced on Friday. Some of the motorists who were caught speeding on the busy road have already paid fines and they will now be refunded. A full breakdown of the figures shows that 800 notices were paid and penalty points applied while a further 123 fines were paid but the error was identified before these drivers were given penalty points. Garda Ch Supt Jane Humphries said \"this error is very much regretted\". However, she added: \"The level of speeding breaches issued since the camera went operational on December 20, 2024 demonstrates the continued need for all motorists using this road to slow down.\" A spokesperson for the camera provider said: \"At GoSafe, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and safety. During a routine quality assurance check, we identified that the calibration certificate for radar components in a static speed camera on the N17 in Mayo had expired.\" \"To prevent a recurrence, we have implemented enhanced safeguards within our quality assurance process,\" the spokesperson added. Motorists impacted by error are now being notified by gardaí. The speed safety camera system went live on 20 December 2024. It was not operational between 1 January 2025 and 17 January 2025 as it had been vandalised. This means that all the 1,871 speeding notices were issued over a period of 39 operational days. The N17 became part of Irish folklore after an Irish band, The Saw Doctors, released a song of the same name around 1990. It was a nostalgic Irish emigration song at the height of mass emigration from the country and the band subsequently became hugely popular in Ireland and among Irish communities in the UK and US as well as in other parts of the world. There are currently \"major issues\" on roads outside many schools, North Yorkshire Council says. Roads near the school will be closed to traffic during busy times following a successful 18-month trial. New signs are installed around Port St Mary to remind motorists of the newly introduced limits. Twenty new places across Oxfordshire will see ANPR cameras enforcing traffic restrictions.

       " 'A freight train carrying the highly toxic chemical benzene has derailed in the Czech Republic, sparking a huge fire. Several tankers and a locomotive were ablaze, with firefighters from several regions and a mobile chemical laboratory deployed to the area, according to local media. A massive cloud of dense black smoke was visible for several kilometres. Railway officials say nobody was injured in the incident, which occurred near Hustopeče nad Bečvou, 50km (31 miles) south-west of the Polish border, on Friday. Benzene, which is a cancer-causing substance for humans, is an element present in aircraft fuel. The train \"split apart\" and subsequently derailed, according to initial reports. A nearby electric substation also caught fire, killing power to the nearby town of Hustopeče. Flames up to 20m high were visible when the fire broke out, one eyewitness told the Lidove Noviny newspaper. Dramatic drone footage from the scene, released by the Czech fire service, shows several badly charred and destroyed tankers - some still burning as thick black smoke spews into the sky. Firefighters used heavy foam to prevent the fire from spreading further, while other tankers were hosed down to prevent more explosions.  A helicopter was also deployed, as well as a special chemical monitoring mobile lab. It took several hours to bring the fire under control, officials said. The fire affected around 15 of the 17 benzene tanks the train had been transporting, a fire department spokesperson told local media. \"The substance should be the same in all tankers, the amount will be specified, but it is approximately 60 tonnes in one tanker. However, this does not mean that everything will burn out or leak,\" Lucie Balážová said. Locals have been told to stay indoors and not open windows or doors. Officials say air quality \"has not yet exceeded\" any pollution limits, according to Czech news website iDNES. Police say they will investigate the cause of the derailment. Benzene is a colourless or light-yellow liquid with a sweet smell that can evaporate very quickly. It is used in common substances like plastic, resin, nylon and some forms of dyes, pesticides or detergents. It is very flammable. Exposure to benzene through breathing or ingestion can cause symptoms like drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, vomiting or sleeplessness. Very high levels of exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death, according to the CDC. Long-term exposure of a year or more could cause issues with blood, bone marrow or the immune system.

       " 'Romania\\'s Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday. The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to \"conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially\". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair\\'s US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking.  On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to \"immediately request Tate\\'s extradition from the US to the UK to face justice\". They said in a joint statement that if it did not, \"it won\\'t just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence\". They added: \"We do not doubt the home secretary\\'s personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words.\" The brothers\\' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release. Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania.  She told the BBC Andrew Tate was \"technically correct\" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge. In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form.  In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live. \"It\\'s actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them,\" Ms Tabusca explained.  \"A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government\\xa0would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there.\" Romania\\'s justice minister said the Tate brothers \"risk pre-trial detention\" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. \"There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation,\" Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania. Calls for a public explanation of why their travel ban was lifted comes as many Romanians express concern that there appears to be one law for the rich and influential, and another for ordinary citizens. The two flew in a private jet from Romania to Fort Lauderdale in Florida. The 38-year-old former kickboxer once said women should \"bear responsibility\" for sexual assault. Brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate arrive in the US from Romania after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted. Prosecutors are investigating a series of alleged offences, after Georgescu came from nowhere to win the first round. Charity says German Shepherd has spent her whole life chained to a tree.

       " 'At least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union\\'s law enforcement organisation Europol has said. The suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency. The operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material (CSAM), Europol said. The lack of national legislation against these crimes made it \"exceptionally challenging for investigators\", it added. Arrests were made simultaneously on Wednesday 26 February during Operation Cumberland, led by Danish law enforcement, a statement said. Authorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved and the operation is still continuing, with more arrests expected in the next few weeks, Europol said. In addition to the arrests, so far 272 suspects have been identified, 33 house searches have been conducted and 173 electronic devices have been seized, according to the agency.  It also said the main suspect was a Danish national who was arrested in November 2024. The statement said he \"ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced\".  After making a \"symbolic online payment\", users from around the world were able to get a password that allowed them to \"access the platform and watch children being abused\".  The agency said online child sexual exploitation was one of the top priorities for the European Union\\'s law enforcement organisations, which were dealing with \"an ever-growing volume of illegal content\". Europol added that even in cases when the content was fully artificial and there was no real victim depicted, such as with Operation Cumberland, \"AI-generated CSAM still contributes to the objectification and sexualisation of children\". Europol\\'s executive director Catherine De Bolle said: \"These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge.\" She warned law enforcement would need to develop \"new investigative methods and tools\" to address the emerging challenges. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced and becoming more prevalent on the open web. In research last year the charity found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%. Experts say AI child sexual abuse material can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake. Copyright 2025 BBC.

       " 'Greeks are holding their biggest protests for years and taking part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured. \"I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice,\" said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens. It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece. An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing. The report by Greece\\'s Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. \"Those children were killed because the train was not safe,\" said the authority\\'s chief Christos Papadimitriou. The Tempi disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials. The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives. By early afternoon, tempers flared and clashes broke out with police. Petrol bombs were thrown and police used tear gas. Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read \"I have no oxygen - justice to the end\", referring to the 57 who died. Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK. The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa.  Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train. In Athens, protesters held placards reading \"My child, call me when you arrive\" and \"No cover-up\".  What happened at the Tempi rail disaster? Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. \"I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident\", she told BBC. \"We demand that all the evidence come to light.\" Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work. Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square. Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge. In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone\\'s thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night. \"Nothing will ever be the same any more,\" he added, speaking of \"fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state\". In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move \"more dynamically and quickly\" to bring about modern and safe trains. For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances. Thursday\\'s inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy. Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring.  \"It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel,\" the report found. \"Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed,\" experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up. Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report. Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and \"landfill\" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene. As he stood in the midst of Friday\\'s protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident. \"I don\\'t know how I find the strength to stand,\" he told BBC.  \"My son gives me the strength. Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t be here today demanding justice.\" Hundreds are thought to have died when the Adriana sank in international waters two years ago.   The Greek island\\'s most important industry will bounce back, but staffing is a worry say hoteliers Three more quakes above 4.0 magnitude are registered on Monday near the Greek tourist hotspot.

       " 'Thirty-two people were deported from the Republic of Ireland to Georgia on a chartered flight on Thursday night. It was the first operation conducted under a contract signed by the Republic last November for the provision of charter flights for deportations. All of those taken to Tbilisi on the flight were Georgian nationals who had been subject to deportation orders. The group was made up of 28 men, three women and a child who was with their parents. \"A central priority for me and this government is that our immigration laws are robust and enforced,\" Irish Justice Minister Jim O\\'Callaghan said. \"People are entitled to have confidence in our immigration system and there must be consequences for individuals who refuse to leave the state when they are ordered to do so.\" He said Thursday\\'s flight was \"a significant start in ensuring that deportation orders are enforced and part of a more effective immigration system generally.  \"There will be further flights scheduled in the future.\" Gardai (police), medical staff, an interpreter and a human rights observer were also onboard the flight. Mr O\\'Callaghan said when a person\\'s application for asylum is refused or they are found to have no permission to be in the state, they are offered assistance to return home voluntarily.  If they do not do so, they are liable to be deported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, he added. The Irish Department of Justice said access to chartered flights \"has significantly increased the capacity of An Garda Síochána to effect removals\". Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: \"Yesterday, the Garda National Immigration Bureau of An Garda Síochána, in a planned operation, carried out the removal of 32 persons from Ireland to Georgia.  \"This was the largest removal operation carried out by GNIB in over six years. A \"An Garda Síochána continues to play its role in enforcing immigration legislation and maintaining the security and integrity of our borders.\" Minister of State for Migration Colm Brophy said: \"Chartered deportation flights will now form an important part of removing people who do not have a right to remain in our country.  \"I look forward to now seeing chartered flights in conjunction with voluntary deportations, ensuring that we will have a firm and effective system in place to deal with deportations going forward.\" The former home secretary launches a petition to stop government plans for Wates House in Fareham.

       " 'The taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) has been invited to the White House by US President Donald Trump to celebrate St Patrick\\'s Day next month. The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday. A spokesperson for the Taoiseach Micheál Martin told BBC News NI that he was \"delighted to accept and looks forward to meeting the president\".  \"The embassy in Washington will continue to engage with the White House team on the details of our visit,\" she added. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Martin received the invitation in a letter from the US president. It said Trump\\'s letter congratulated the taoiseach on his recent appointment and highlighted the special bond between the Irish and American people. It is customary for Irish leaders to travel to the US every March for an audience with the president at the White House.  They present their host with a bowl of shamrock - a tradition that dates back to President Harry Truman in 1952. Martin is serving his second term as taoiseach, having previously led his country from June 2020 to December 2022. However, he was not able to visit the White House on St Patrick\\'s Day in 2021 because of Covid travel restrictions.  He did make the trip to Washington DC in March 2022 but he could not visit the White House in person because he contracted Covid while in the US.  As a result, Martin\\'s previous St Patrick\\'s Day duties as taoiseach consisted of video calls with Trump\\'s predecessor Joe Biden.  The annual Washington visit is viewed as an important political opportunity to strengthen US and Irish diplomatic relations and boost cross-Atlantic trade.  The Republic of Ireland is particularly vulnerable to threats of US tariffs on European imports and Trump\\'s \"America First\" policy.  In 2023, the US was the number-one country for Irish goods exports, buying products worth €54bn. That meant  just over a quarter of Irish goods exports were sold into this one market. Earlier this week, Trump said he was planning to impose tariffs of about 25% on goods made in the European Union, of which Ireland is member.  On Thursday, the Tánaiste (deputy PM) Simon Harris told the Dáil (Irish Parliament) it has never been a more important time for ministers to travel abroad for talks.  Almost 40 Irish ministers and other state officials will make St Patrick\\'s Day trips to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand.  Visiting Trump in the White House can also have political perils at home however because of his controversial foreign policy announcements.  In Northern Ireland,  Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said they would boycott the White House this St Patrick\\'s Day because of Trump\\'s stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Alliance Party has also confirmed they will not attend the events, but Northern Ireland\\'s Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly is going to Washington DC.  Asked about her plans, Little-Pengelly said it was important to \"maintain long and rewarding\" relationships with the US. \"It\\'s important we engage regardless of what our personal views may or may not be. That\\'s what I\\'ll be doing on St Patrick\\'s Day,\" she added. Almost 2,000 motorists caught speeding on an uncertified camera have had fines overturned. The United States has never had an official language since it was founded nearly 250 years ago. Donald Trump will not get involved in security guarantees for Ukraine, but can Europe fill the gap? Thousands of workers have been fired by the Trump administration as part of its effort to slash the federal workforce.

He will remain in hospital due to a complex clinical picture, the Vatican said on Friday morning. It added the 88-year-old had another \"peaceful night\" and is \"now resting\" in Rome\\'s Gemelli Hospital. Italian news agency Ansa reported that the pontiff was now out of the \"critical phase\", citing Vatican sources. The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Then, on 22 February, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a \"critical\" condition, but later on Sunday released an update saying that he had \"not presented any further respiratory crises\". The following day, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. But, while the Vatican said the Pope\\'s health is improving, it added that \"further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis\". The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023. From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church. The Reverend Canon Dave Bull is consecrated as the new Bishop of Buckingham. Founders of a new Blackburn mosque says support from the community has been \"overwhelming\".  The Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, Martin Seeley, says retirement feels \"really strange\". The latest statement suggests that the 88-year-old is able to sit in his chair, eat normally and do what the Vatican calls \"light work\".  Around the world, prayers and services are being held in support of the pontiff. Copyright 2025 BBC.
