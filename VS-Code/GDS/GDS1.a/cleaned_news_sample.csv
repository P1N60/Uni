(see, e.g., here, here, and here.) the decis wa inevitable. obama, use a pseudonym email account, had repeatedli commun with secretari clinton over her private, non-secur email account. these email must have involv some classifi information, given the natur of consult between presid and secretari of state, the broad outlin of obama’ own execut order defin classifi intellig (see eo , section .), and the fact that the obama administr adamantli refus to disclos the clinton-obama emails. if classifi inform wa mishandled, it wa necessarili mishandl on both end of these email exchanges. if clinton had been charged, obama’ culpabl involv would have been patent. in ani prosecut of clinton, the clinton-obama email would have been in the spotlight. for the prosecution, they would be more proof of will (or, if you prefer, grossli negligent) mishandl of intelligence. more significantly, for clinton’ defense, they would show that obama wa complicit in clinton’ conduct yet face no crimin charges. that is whi such an indict of hillari clinton wa never go to happen. the latest jaw-drop disclosur of text messag between fbi agent peter strzok and hi paramour, fbi lawyer lisa page, illustr thi point. for the moment, i want to put asid the latest controversi – the fbi’ failur to retain five month of text messag between strzok and page, those chattiest of star-cross lovers. yes, thi “glitch” close our window on a critic time in the trump-russia investigation: mid decemb through mid may . that is when the bureau and justic depart were reportedli conduct and renew (in -day intervals) court-approv fisa surveil that may well have focus on the newli sworn-in presid of the unit states. (remember: the bureau’ then-director, jame comey, testifi at a march hous intellig committe hear that the investig wa probe possibl coordin with trump’ campaign and kremlin interfer in the election.) the retent default ha been chalk up to a technolog mishap. assum that thi truli wa an indiscriminate, bureau-wid problem – that lost text are not limit to phone involv in the trump-russia investig – it is hard to imagin it go undetect for five month in an agenc whose busi is inform retention. but it is not inconceivable. attorney gener jeff session maintain that an aggress inquiri is underway, so let’ assum (for argument’ sake, at least) that either the text will be recov or a satisfactori explan for their non-retent will be forthcoming. for now, let’ stick with the clinton-obama emails. onli juli , , comey held the press confer at which he deliv a statement describ mrs. clinton’ crimin conduct but nevertheless recommend against an indictment. we now know that comey’ remark had been in the work for two month and were revis sever time by the director and hi advisers. thi past weekend, in a letter to the fbi regard the miss texts, senat homeland secur committe chairman ron johnson (r., wis.) address some of these revisions. accord to senat johnson, a draft date june , (i.e., five day befor comey deliv the final version), contain a passag expressli refer to a troublesom email exchang between clinton and obama. (i note that the fbi’ report of it eventu interview of clinton contain a cryptic refer to a juli , , email that clinton sent from russia to obama’ email address. see report, page .) the passag in the june draft stated: we also assess that secretari clinton’ use of a person email domain wa both known by a larg number of peopl and readili apparent. she also use her person email extens while outsid the unit states, includ from the territori of sophist adversaries. that use includ an email exchang with the presid while secretari clinton wa on the territori of such an adversary. [emphasi added.] given that combin of factors, we assess it is possibl that hostil actor gain access to secretari clinton’ person email account. on the same day, accord to a strzok-pag text, a revis draft of comey’ remark wa circul by hi chief of staff, jim rybicki. it replac “the president” with “anoth senior govern official.” thi effort to obscur obama’ involv had an obviou flaw: it would practic have beg congression investig and enterpris journalist to press for the identif of the “senior govern official” with whom clinton had exchang emails. that wa not go to work. consequently, by the time comey deliv hi remark on juli , the decis had been made to avoid even a veil allus to obama. instead, all the stress wa place on clinton (who wa not go to be charg anyway) for irrespons send and receiv sensit email that were like to have been penetr by hostil intellig services. comey made no refer to clinton’ correspondent: we also assess that secretari clinton’ use of a person e-mail domain wa both known by a larg number of peopl and readili apparent. she also use her person e-mail extens while outsid the unit states, includ send and receiv work-rel e-mail in the territori of sophist adversaries. [emphasi added.] given that combin of factors, we assess it is possibl that hostil actor gain access to secretari clinton’ person e-mail account. the decis to purg ani refer to obama is consist with the panic that seiz hi administr from the moment clinton’ use of a private, non-secur server system wa reveal in earli march . i detail thi reaction in a seri of column (see, e.g., here and here). what most alarm obama and clinton advis (those group overlap) wa not onli that there were sever clinton-obama email exchanges, but also that obama dissembl about hi knowledg of clinton’ privat email use in a nation televis interview. on march , just after the new york time broke the news about clinton’ email practic at the state department, john podesta (a top obama advis and clinton’ campaign chairman) email cheryl mill (clinton’ confid and top aid in the obama state department) to suggest that clinton’ “email to and from potus” should be “held” – i.e., not disclos – becaus “that’ the heart of hi exec privilege.” at the time, the hous committe investig the benghazi jihadist attack wa press for product of clinton’ emails. as hi counselor grappl with how to address hi own involv in clinton’ misconduct, obama decept told cb news in a march interview that he had found out about clinton’ use of person email to conduct state depart busi “the same time everybodi els learn it through news reports.” perhap he wa confid that, becaus he had use an alia in commun with clinton, hi email to and from her – estim to number around – would remain undiscovered. hi and clinton’ advis were not so confident. right after the interview aired, clinton campaign secretari josh scherwin email jennif palmieri and other senior campaign staffers, stating: “jen you probabl have more on thi but it look like potu just said he found out hrc wa use her person email when he saw it on the news.” scherwin’ alert wa forward to mills. shortli afterwards, an agit mill email podesta: “we need to clean thi up – he ha email from her – they do not say state.gov.” (that is, obama had email from clinton, which he had to know were from a privat account sinc her address did not end in “@state.gov” as state depart email do.) so how did obama and hi helper “clean thi up”? obama had hi email commun with clinton sealed. he did thi by invok a dubiou presidential-record privilege. the white hous insist that the matter had noth to do with the content of the emails, of course; rather, it wa intend to vindic the principl of confidenti in presidenti commun with close advisers. with the media content to play along, thi had a twofold benefit: obama wa abl () to sidestep disclosur without acknowledg that the email contain classifi inform and () to avoid use the term “execut privilege” – with all it dark waterg connot – even though that wa precis what he wa invoking. note that claim of execut privileg must yield to demand for disclosur of relev evid in crimin prosecutions. but of course, that’ not a problem if there will be no prosecution. the white hous purport to repair the president’ disingenu statement in the cb interview by ration that he had meant that he learn of clinton’ homebrew server system through news report – he hadn’t meant to claim unawar that she occasion use privat email. thi wa sheer misdirection: from obama’ standpoint, the problem wa that he discuss govern intellig matter with the secretari of state through a privat email account; the fact that, in addition, clinton’ privat email account wa connect to her own privat server system, rather than some other privat email service, wa besid the point. but, again, the media wa not interest in such distinct and contentedli accept the white house’ non-explanation. meanwhile, attorney gener loretta lynch order comey to use the word “matter” rather than “investigation” to describ the fbi’ probe of clinton’ email practices. thi ensur that the democrat administration’ law-enforc agenc were align their stori with the democrat candidate’ campaign rhetoric. if there wa no investigation, there would be no prosecution. in april , in anoth nation televis interview, obama made clear that he did not want clinton to be indicted. hi rational wa a legal frivol straw man: clinton had not intend to harm nation security. thi wa not an element of the feloni offens she had committed; nor wa it in dispute. no matter: obama’ analysi wa the state view of the chief executive. if, as wa sure to happen, hi subordin in the execut law-enforc agenc conform their decis to hi state view, there would be no prosecution. within a few weeks, even though the investig wa ostens still underway and over a dozen key wit – includ clinton herself – had not yet been interviewed, the fbi began draft comey’ remark that would close the investigation. there would be no prosecution. on june , lynch met with clinton’ husband, former presid bill clinton, on an out-of-the-way arizona tarmac, where their secur detail arrang for both their plane to be parked. over the next few days, the fbi took pain to strike ani refer to obama’ email with mrs. clinton from the statement in which comey would effect end the “matter” with no prosecution. on juli , amid intens public critic of her meet with bill clinton, attorney gener lynch piousli announc that she would accept whatev recommend the fbi director and career prosecutor made about charg clinton. as page told strzok in a text that day, “thi is a purpos leak follow the airplan snafu.” it wa also playacting. page elabor that the attorney gener alreadi “know no charg will be brought.” of cours she did: it wa understood by all involv that there would be no prosecution. know that, lynch had given the fbi notic on june that she’d be announc her intent to accept comey’ recommendation. fear thi just might look a bit choreographed, the fbi promptli amend comey’ plan remark to includ thi assert (which he in fact made on juli ): “i have not coordin or review thi statement in ani way with the depart of justic or ani other part of the government. they do not know what i am about to say.” but they did not need to particip in draft the statement, and they did not need to know the precis word he wa go to use. it wa not comey’ decis anyway. all they need to know wa that there would be no prosecution. on juli , with the decis that she would not be indict long sinc made, mrs. clinton sat for an interview with the fbi – someth she’d never have done if there were a chanc she might be charged. the farc wa complet with the justic depart and fbi permit two subject of the investig – mill and clinton aid heather samuelson – to sit in on the interview as lawyer repres clinton. that is not someth law enforc abid when it is seriou about make a case. here, however, it wa clear: there would be no prosecution. all clean up: no indictment, mean no prosecution, mean no disclosur of clinton-obama emails. it all work like a charm . . . except the part where mrs. clinton win the presid and the problem is never spoken of again. a version of thi piec also appear on nation review online. http://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/clintonobama-emails-the-key-to-understanding-why-hillary-wasnt-indict read more great articl here: http://familysecuritymatters.org",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Clinton–Obama Emails: Key to Understanding Why Hillary Wasn’t Indicted – Andrew McCarthy,John Rolls,,[''],,,

it is a mission,” the pope wrote in hi messag releas jan. . “amid feed frenzi and the mad rush for a scoop, they must rememb that the heart of inform is not the speed with which it is report or it audienc impact, but persons.” “inform other mean form others; it mean be in touch with people’ lives,” he continued. “that is whi ensur the accuraci of sourc and protect commun are real mean of promot goodness, gener trust, and open the way to communion and peace.” francis’ messag for the next world day of social commun wa releas jan. , the feast day of st. franci de sales, the patron saint of journalists. the nd annual celebr will take place may , , on the theme: “‘the truth will set you free’ (jn :). fake news and journal for peace.” “in today’ fast-chang world of commun and digit systems, we are wit the spread of what ha come to be known as ‘fake news,’” the pope said. “in thi way, i would like to contribut to our share commit to stem the spread of fake news and to rediscov the digniti of journal and the person respons of journalist to commun the truth.” the best “antidote” to the spread of falsehood in ‘fake news’ aren’t strategies, he stated, but people. “peopl who are not greedi but readi to listen, peopl who make the effort to engag in sincer dialogu so that the truth can emerge; peopl who are attract by good and take respons for how they use language.” everyon ha the duti to counter the lie found in ‘fake news,’ he said. but an even weightier respons fall upon those whose job it is to provid the world with information, namely, journalists, the “protector of news.” franci went on to encourag everyon to promot “a journal of peace,” which he said doesn’t mean some saccharin or sentiment report that refus to acknowledg the exist of real and seriou problems. rather, he emphasized, a journal of peac is journal that is “truth and oppos to falsehoods, rhetor slogans, and sensat headlines. a journal creat by peopl for people, one that is at the servic of all, especi those – and they are the major in our world – who have no voice.” a journalism, he continued, that is less focus on break news, and more on explor the underli caus of conflicts, so that it can promot a deeper understand and contribut to resolut “bi set in place virtuou processes” and offer altern to “shout matches.” the first ‘fake news,’ franci said, wa that creat by the “crafti serpent” in the book of genesis, who use falsehood to tempt eve into disobey god. “the strategi of thi skill ‘father of lies’ (jn :) is precis mimicry, that sli and danger form of seduct that worm it way into the heart with fals and allur arguments,” he said. eve’ temptat by the serpent “bring to light an essenti element for our reflection: there is no such thing as harmless disinformation.” he point out how constant exposur to decept languag can also have harm consequ on our interior life, as illustr by a quot from fyodor dostoevsky’ the brother karamazov. “peopl who lie to themselv and listen to their own lie come to such a pass that they cannot distinguish the truth within them, or around them, and so lose all respect for themselv and for others. and have no respect, they ceas to love, and in order to occupi and distract themselv without love they give way to passion and to coars pleasures, and sink to bestial in their vices, all from continu lie to other and to themselves.” so how do we defend ourselv from thi evil, franci asked. “the most radic antidot to the viru of falsehood is purif by the truth,” which in christian is more than just a judgment of thing as true or false, he said. it’ also more than just reveal thing that are concealed, he continued: “truth involv our whole life.” “truth is someth you can lean on, so as not to fall,” he said. “in thi relat sense, the onli truli reliabl and trustworthi one – the one on whom we can count – is the live god. hence, jesu can say: ‘i am the truth.’” “to thi end, draw inspir from a franciscan prayer, we might turn to the truth in person,” he concluded, offer the follow prayer: “lord, make us instrument of your peace. help us to recogn the evil latent in a commun that doe not build communion. help us to remov the venom from our judgements. help us to speak about other as our brother and sisters. you are faith and trustworthy;

the same question can be ask in countless other examples, whether the bataclan night club in paris, the nord-ost sieg in the dubrovka theater in moscow, the virginia tech massacr in , the washington navi yard attack in the navsea build in septemb , the san bernardino shooting, or the puls nightclub shoot in june, . in almost everi case the problem amount to a “time” problem. the time problem consist of the follow issues: (a) tri to locat a shooter and (b) attempt to reach the shooter and neutral him (or her). even with current secur systems, it is not easi to locat a shooter. the reason for thi are the lack of proper coverag by camera and sensor lead to mani blind spots, the inabl to interpret surveil imag when they are available, the fact that a shooter may be move around (although it would seem in the la vega case, from what we know now, that the shooter oper from a hotel room and smash out window so he could fire on the countri music festival). most secur system in the unit states, and elsewher in the world, were design or more year ago. while some improv have been made (wifi digit camera replac old analog cameras), overal the natur of these system ha not chang much. what they offer are “pictures” from differ camera that are flash across a comput screen or a tv monitor. someon in a command center is suppos to watch these pictur and sound an alarm if someth happen and if they “see” it. thi type of secur “system” primarili is valuabl for collect forens inform after an incid or suspect intrusion. there the video feed can be examined. even in london, one of the most wired-up citi in the world, it take polic anywher from hour to day to make use of surveil camera video footag as an aid to apprehend a terrorist. obviously, that is helpful, but it would be better if the camera feed could be access in a more direct fashion. an isra inventor who wa the lead manag for instal secur system in sensit isra villag and who also built a secur system for a prison along the egyptian border (to keep terrorist out, not just to keep prison in), saw thi weak in current secur system and set out to fix the problem. hi name is eran jedwab and hi product is call jedeye. it is the first system to bolt onto tradit secur system and provid secur guard and polic with real-tim situat awar of a threat includ full visual of a facil or campus. the system is now be instal at locat in the unit states. other technolog also could be veri useful, but promot them ha been a “hard sell” in the unit states. one of them is gunshot detectors. gunshot detector can actual locat a shooter in a millisecond, can aim camera in the shooter’ locat and can even be slave to sniper rifl in the hand of law enforcement. while gunshot detector in the past are fix in place, today mobil gunshot detector can be mount on polic vehicles. there are a few compani that offer such product includ shotspott in newark, california and safeti dynam in tucson, arizona. had a mobil gunshot detector been in la vegas, the shooter would have been accur locat immediately. it would help a great deal if the depart of homeland secur (dhs) wa more proactiv in sponsor and test new technolog aim at reduc the time it take to neutral an activ shooter or an intruder. while dh (through the tsa) ha spent heavili on airport passeng and baggag secur systems, much of the rest ha been underfund or neglected. now is the time for dhs, support by the congress, to go into high gear in sponsor solut that reduc the time it take to stop a terrorist. http://www.americanthinker.com/articles///the_time_factor_and_active_shooter_incidents.html#ixzzuzctrv read more great articl here: http://americanthinker.com",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,The Time Factor: Active Shooter Incidents,John Rolls,,[''],,,

german militari command and hitler’ design successor here are some of the lesson we in the unit state learn too late about allow our freedom to be eviscer in exchang for the phantom promis of security. what remain to be seen is whether france, stand where the unit state did year ago, will follow in america’ footstep as she grappl with the best way to shore up her defenses, where to draw the delic line in balanc secur with liberty, and what it mean to secur justic for those whose live were taken. onc again, there is that same sens of shock. the same shock imag of carnag and grief

fear that thi could easili have happen to us or our love ones. bewar of mammoth legisl that expand the government’ power at the citizenry’ expense. rush through congress a mere day after the / attacks, the usa patriot act drove a stake through the heart of the bill of rights, undermin civil liberties, expand the government’ power and open the door to far-reach surveil by the govern on american citizens. pre-empt strike will onli lead to further blowback. not content to wage war against afghanistan, which serv as the base for osama bin laden, the u.s. embark on a pre-empt war against iraq in order to “stop ani adversari challeng america’ militari superior and adopt a strike-first polici against terrorist threat ‘befor they'r fulli formed.’” we are still suffer the consequ of thi fail policy, which ha result in live lost, taxpay dollar wasted, the foment of hatr against the u.s. and the further radic of terrorist cells. war is costly. there are mani reason to go to war, but those who have advoc that the u.s. remain at war, year after year, are the veri entiti that have profit most from these endless militari occup and exercises. thu far, the u.s. taxpay ha been made to shell out more than $. trillion on “militari operations, the train of secur forc in afghanistan and iraq, weapon maintenance, base support, reconstruction, embassi maintenance, foreign aid, and veterans’ medic care, as well as war-rel intellig oper not track by the pentagon” sinc . other estim that account for war-rel spending, veterans’ benefit and variou promissori note place that figur

make you no better than terrorists. the horror that took place at abu ghraib, the american-run prison in iraq, continu to shock those with ani decency. photograph leak to the media depict “u militari

waterboarding, in violat of intern law and continu to sanction human right violat in the pursuit of nation security. the ramif have been far-reaching, with local polic now employ similar tortur tactic at secret locat such as homan squar in chicago. allow the govern to spi on the citizenri will not reduc act of terrorism, but it will result in a watched, submissive, surveil society. a byproduct of thi post /-age in which we live, whether you’r walk through a store, drive your car, check email, or talk to friend and famili on the phone, you can be sure that some govern agency, whether the nsa or some other entity, is listen in and track your behavior. thi doesn’t even begin to touch on the corpor tracker such as googl that monitor your purchases, web browsing, facebook post and other activ take place in the cyber sphere. we are all becom data collect in govern files. the chill effect of thi endless surveil is a more anxiou and submiss citizenry. don’t becom so distract by the news cycl that you lose sight of what the govern is doing. the averag american ha a hard time keep up with and rememb all of the “events,” manufactur or otherwise, which occur like clockwork and keep us distracted, deluded, amused, and insul from the realiti of the american polic state. whether these event are critic or unimportant, when we’r be bombard with wall-to-wal news coverag and news cycl that chang everi few days, it’ difficult to stay focus on one thing—namely, hold the govern account to abid by the rule of law—and the powers-that-b understand this. in thi way, regularli schedul trivia and/or distract that keep the citizenri tune into the variou break news headlin and entertain spectacl also keep them tune out to the government’ steadi encroach on their freedoms. if you stop hold the govern account to the rule of law, the onli law it abid by will be the one use to clamp down on the citizenry. have fail to hold govern offici account to abid by the rule of law, the american peopl have found themselv saddl with a govern that skirts, flout and violat the constitut with littl consequence. overcriminalization, asset forfeitur schemes, polic brutality, profit-driven prisons, warrantless surveillance, swat team raids, indefinit detentions, covert agencies, and secret court are just a few of the egregi practic carri out by a govern that oper beyond the reach of the law. do not turn your countri into a battlefield, your citizen into enemi combatants, and your law enforc offic into extens of the military. a stand army—someth that propel the earli colonist into revolution—strip the citizenri of ani vestig of freedom. how can there be ani semblanc of freedom when there are tank in the streets, militari encamp in cities, blackhawk helicopt and arm drone patrol overhead? it wa for thi reason that those who establish america vest control of the militari in a civilian government, with a civilian commander-in-chief. they did not want a militari government, rule by force. rather, they opt for a republ bound by the rule of law: the u.s. constitution. unfortunately, we in america now find ourselv struggl to retain some semblanc of freedom in the face of polic and law enforc agenc that look and act like the militari and have just as littl regard for the fourth amendment, law such as the ndaa that allow the militari to arrest and indefinit detain american citizens, and militari drill that acclim the american peopl to the sight of armor tank in the streets, militari encamp in cities, and combat aircraft patrol overhead. as long as you remain fear and distrust of each other, you will be incap of stand unit against ani threat pose by a power-hungri government. earli on, u.s. offici solv the problem of how to implement their authoritarian polici without incur a citizen uprising: fear. the powers-that-b want us to feel threaten by forc beyond our control (terrorists, shooters, bombers). they want us afraid and depend on the govern and it militar armi for our safeti and well-being. most of all, they want us distrust of each other, divid by our prejudices, and at each other’ throats. if you trade your freedom for security, the terrorist win. we’v walk a strang and harrow road sinc septemb , , litter with the debri of our once-vaunt liberties. we have gone from a nation that took great pride in be a model of a repres democraci to be a model of how to persuad a freedom-lov peopl to march in lockstep with a polic state. and in so doing, we have proven osama bin laden right. he warn that “freedom and human right in america are doomed. the u.s. govern will lead the american peopl in — and the west in gener — into an unbear hell and a choke life.” to sum thing up, the destruct that began with the / terror attack ha expand into an all-out campaign of terror, trauma, acclim and indoctrin aim at get american use to life in the american polic state. the bogeyman’ name and face chang over time, but the end result remain the same:

and if not a pre-print reply, then wenner must have miss the teleprompt hang behind hi back. the chief execut did mention ‘we’ sever time by necessity, but quickli revert to the “i did everything” posit of a true narcissist. the standard talk point were that tea parti rube are under unwit control of dick armey and freedom works. tea parti member are ‘anti-immigrant’ and ‘oppos by what i repres as president’ [they’r racist] and oppos to green energi and work place safeti regulations. obama continues, ‘look, as president, i swore to uphold the constitution, and part of that constitut is a

real problem for all true patriots. matt mention kentucki senat candid rand paul and possibl emerg conflict and then mention rand’ dad, rep ron paul and fring candid for president. matt confess that while cover the paul campaign, he like ron becaus “he’ honest, anti-war and pro-legalization”. it is shock to see a liber report agre with so mani libertarian positions. mayb matt is a patriot in the

greg weldon: i’m great, thanks. my pleasure, micheal. mike gleason: well, when we had you on back in mid-august you were optimist about gold at the time. we had a pretti good move higher, shortli thereaft that end up with gold hit a one year high. but it stall out around $, in earli septemb and we’r current back below $, as we’r talk here on wednesday afternoon. gold hit resist at about the same level in the summer of last year, so give us your updat as to your current outlook. what drivers, if any, do you see that can push gold through that $, resist level in the month ahead, greg? greg weldon: yeah, well, exactli as you said. you had the move that we were anticip when we last spoke and it kind of had alreadi start from the -ish level. all of thi fit into the kind of bigger picture, technic structur that still lead to a bullish resolution. but as you accur mentioned, you got up to what have been close to, not quit even toward last summer’ high around $,, $,. in thi case, around $, and ran out of steam. the dollar kind of chang some of the pictur and the thought process link to the fed chang some of the picture. so, you embark on a downsid correction. $, wa the low, you have a nice littl correct from that level. that wa the level that equat to -day exponenti move average. it’ a level that wa just below the % fibonnaci retrac of the move up from $,. actually, the move up from $, back at the end of . so you had real, critic support there. so, to me, everything’ kind of map out the way you might expect it to, structurally, in thi market. from here, one of two thing happens, i think. well, one of three things, anyway. you could be cut if you have a bit of low ralli back up to $,. you back below it a littl bit to dollars; still look kind of strong. it’ an interest rate differenti dynam as a more hawkish view for the fed is price into the fed funds; that get transfer into the two-year and five-year treasuri notes. the two-year treasuri note at a record high-yield rel to the german two-year schatzi. so, that lift the dollar … it’ kind of gravit pull to the upside. and that is some of the downsid risk here; that the ralli we just saw is kind of you b-wave and mayb you have a c-wave down toward $,. that’ kind of an ultim low. whether or not it play out that way, longer term we still like it. mike gleason: preciou metal have had a pretti respect year all in all. gold is up about % year to date. silver is up about half as much. there isn’t exactli a lot of excitement. it seem like it’ alway two step forward, one step back. sentiment in the physic bullion markets, where we operate, is muted. there are multipl factor to consid as to whi metal market are stuck in a bit of a rut. it seem to us that one of the big one is the equiti market stock price just keep march relentlessli higher. either investor have becom total desensit to risk or mayb there just isn’t as much risk as well think there is. in ani event, bar some sort of spike in inflat expectations, which push metal and stock both higher, we don’t see gold and silver break out unless investor start get nervou about stock market valuat and think about safe havens. so what are your thought about equiti market and how they relat to preciou metals, greg? and where do you see stock price head in the near term? greg weldon: yeah, i mean it’ a perfect question becaus the realiti is, and we in our daili research we focus on this, in fact yesterday. we haven’t spoken … it sound like we arrang thi question. focus on the fact that gold, rel to s&p, is at a low. you realli are kind of low that we’v seen before, but at a level where if you get much lower, you’r break down to multi-year low and thi whole thing get call into question from a technic perspective. but my problem with look at it from a technic perspective, is that i think the stock market is live in borrow times. basically, the fed ha done exactli what they want to do. they have flush peopl out of safe haven and into risk assets. that’ the whole idea of qe. it worked. you reflat the stock market. that ha facilit a huge, unpreced rise in consum credit. instead of the hous market be the collater like it wa in and , now it’ the stock market that’ the collateral, the googl and amazon of the world and the facebook of the world. and you have thi demand that is be driven or realli be fed by credit. now you see the credit number start to slow. they’r unsustainable. you start to see the consum roll over a littl bit. so that’ the number one risk to the stock market; it’ actual the consumer. if you look at the retail sale numbers, outsid of automobil and gasoline, which is price-based, you don’t have much of anything. and you have eat and drink growth slowing. that’ a key component, a key layer to the discretionari spend that’ an import tell to the bigger picture. the consum discretionari sector is break down against the s&p. so that’ a warn sign to me. you have, in term of the dynam around what the expect is for gdp growth, predic upon polici that have not yet been even agre upon, let alon vote upon, let alon implemented, let alon start to work. so, i worri about that kind of fractur between the expectations, the patienc level of stock investors, diminish returns, diminish volumes. i think there’ a stock market risk. that’ one of the reason we like gold, becaus what would go hand in hand with that, wa some kind of mayb statement or a pull back on the dot plot from the fed that would then caus the dollar to come off it littl ralli here. mike gleason: let’ play the devil’ advoc mayb a littl here. we look at these record stock price and wonder about what is beyond thi extraordinarili high valuat in the past when pe ratio hit these levels, it wa a signal that market were near a top. but there’ one big differ between the past and today: the advent of high frequenc and machine-driven trading. huge amount of daili volum is gener by trade algorithms. that is a game changer. these program don’t sens risk on an emot level like human trader do. they respond veri differ to geopolit events. so, if today’ market seem disconnect from reality, perhap becaus it’ becaus they are. now you have been on the front lines, trade in these market for decades. you were a wit for how market have transform in recent years. what is your take on high frequenc and algorithm trade and what doe it say about the possibl that current equiti market valuat can be sustain or mayb even push higher? what are your thought there, greg? greg weldon: that’ phenomen question and it’ veri well time given that we did a big special in septemb call “shrinkage,” which is a shift in the fed polici here. but if you take now your question, which is pertin now, and you look at experience, in my experi over decades, it bring back right off the bat. we’r not say the market’ go to crash. there clearli there are a lot of differences. but when you ask about high frequenc trading, it sound to me, the first thing i think of, is portfolio insur on steroids, time a thousand, time ten thousand. so, the risk in term of just what is the catalyst that then caus kind of that cascad downside? one of the thing we’v been point out to our customers… and by the way, i’m work out a gigant special that show just how intrigu some of the similar are around movement in the dollar, movement in bonds, movement in gold, and movement in stocks, and some of the ratios, and even down to crude oil, fed polici and cpi. now as there wa basic from to ’, onc they kick in the plaza accord, which depreci the dollar. a lot of intrigu connect there and the special report that i’m write on this, it’ call “what, me worry?” which we’d love to make avail to ani of your listeners, first of all, if they want to email me. but in term of the catalyst, set it up, again i think the landmin are lay in wait out there. i think if you take an example, one of the things, like i said we’v been tell our customers, if you take amazon or google. stock are trade at $, a share. you need $, to buy one share. so, the volum of trade ha diminish dramat over the last coupl of year as the stock price ha gone up. the ownership is huge. and it’ passive, and it’ manag investments, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t discrimin in term of what type of investor. the peopl who want to own these stocks, own them. the dynam between the price level be so high, nomin speaking, to buy up block shares, the amount of money needed, pure and simple, against the volume, to me, set up someth like you’r talk about that would be exacerb by a flash crash. so, it becom veri scari in term of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball roll to the downside. i still think that thi is someth that will play out over some time. i think the fed is there. i don’t think thi is … there are a lot of differences. i’m not tri to make a direct ’ comparison. but i’ll tell you what, the risk is there. no doubt about it. the risk is rising. mike gleason: in term of the fed here, greg, what is your think on who it might be that talk over for janet yellen as the next fed chair and then also, tell us what you think they’r go to do here in term of get inflat to where they want? basically, what are your gener thought on the fed and fed monetari policy? clearli everyone’ favorit subject. greg weldon: really, it’ two total separ question right now becaus who is donald trump go to pick versu how inflat go to play out. i think if you look at what the fed is saying, the fed ha been veri clear. thi is where (jerome) powel becomes, what seem to be, and i’m not say i believ this, i’m just say it seem that powell’ a logic choic if, if, your goal is to maintain policy. think about bring in a guy like (john) taylor, and the taylor rule and where the natur level of fed fund should be here, he would obvious be a much more hawkish choice. while him and trump might have realli gotten along, and mayb there’ a lot trump can learn from him, i don’t think that’ the guy trump want in term of polici for tri to get hi growth agenda going. in that context, how you maintain continuity, which realli isn’t that bad. they’r certainli not tight and they’r not tighten to ani nth degree. it’ almost goldilock materi here, inflat aside. powel is a logic choic becaus you make a headlin splash, which of cours he loves. you basic make a change, but you kind of keep the statu quo. the other one would be (kevin) warsh. he wa more away from qe and toward just use interest rates. he’ an interest kind of dark horse. yellen is certainli a dark horse. what matt realli is how doe the fed decid they’r go to deal with thi inflat issu when they can’t even decid what’ caus it? becaus you keep hear transitory, idiosyncratic. these are the word that be use repeatedly, over and over and over again to describe, and you’v had one fed offici go so far as, and even yellen herself ha made comment to the effect of, “we don’t understand whi it’ not materializing.” again, kind of back to the taylor model, the basic rule of thumb that the fed is count on, i.e. hope for, is that as the labor market continu to tighten wages, inflat will go up and that will support of a gener rise in prices. the question now becom is the natur rate of unemploy lower than we thought it was. or, are there structur differ now, technolog base dynam in the labor market that ha hollow out the labor market, the reason you still have particip rate while final up a little, is still so low historically, therein lie the question. what is it kind of keep inflat back and how doe thi play out? i think the employ number from thi month, for september, were huge in the sens it wa the biggest wage number … and you know how i break the number down. to the nth degree, thi wa the real deal. onli one month, but still the real deal, and the best wage number we’v seen sinc . so, will that continue? we know anecdot evid is there. will thi continu over the next coupl of months? if you look at cpi and ppi, the pipeline, the year-over-year dynam around some of the commodities, god forbid, grains, oil seeds, and tropic commod start to ralli becaus then you’d have a real problem. look at what the base model are doing. look at what energi potenti you’r go to break out here. so, i think there is some inflat come and it’ apt to push the fed to have to rais to meet their dot plots, and i think that’ go to be problemat for the equiti markets. they’r walk the high wire act with no safeti net. it’ a veri difficult job. mike gleason: get back to metal here for a bit. we would like to give our listen an updat on the silver and gold price rig scandal that erupt a year and a half ago when deutsch bank wa forc to acknowledg cheat and turn over mountain of evidence, which may prove damn for a number of other banks. but the court and regul have a record of move slowly, if they do anyth at all. now you’r much closer to the futur market than we are. are you awar of ani develop on that front and what do you see as the implic of the civil action against the bullion banks? do you sens that the deutsch bank revel here led to more honest markets, perhap becaus of all that evid struck fear into banker’ heart or is it more busi as usual for these bullion bank who seem to have so much influenc in these markets, greg? greg weldon: i have the sens it’ busi as usual. i get the sens that it’ a kind of laissez fair attitud about that becaus the problem is so big, if we were to actual kind of get unearthed, the impact would be much, much larger and we would know it base on the price section veri quickly. it’ a powder keg. it’ll blow at some point. thi is something, gosh i’v been in the busi how long, and we’v been talk about thi how long? really, thi goe way, way back. the degre to which it ha gotten wors is, i mean, the thing you debate, not whether it exist or not. is it go to be somehow uncov to the extent that it caus that kind of disruption? i think again, thi is probabl fodder for a great movie… a spi movi or whatever. sure, there’ probabl a lot of that kind of thing go on in background, but in term of the day to day oper of the trade of these metals, i don’t see ani tangibl impact in the deal i have here, no. mike gleason: well greg, as we begin to close, give us a sens of what you’r focus on here, mayb some of the thing that we haven’t touch on and then give us a sens of how you’r evalu these market for your clients. do you think it’ time to get defensive, go to cash, favor metal and commod here as an inflat hedge, or doe the wave of exuber in stock still have a way to go? ani final comment or anyth els that you want to leav us with today? greg weldon: well, i think some of that depend on whether they can actual get some kind of job done in washington where the republican final realiz their own neck are on the chop block here, so let’ final ban togeth and get a tax reform packag done. we’ll see whether that happens. i think that might be one of those last ga type of move for the stock market. it could be a “buy the rumor sell the fact,” but i think lot ha been price in and i think there’ still go to be disappoint down the road for that. i’m watch the consum specifically. the retail sale number have been realli poor all year. it’ minuscul gain in discretionari item sinc january. and the debt number are interesting. you’r start to see a roll over, start to see rise in delinqu rates. the debt oblig for consum and for the feder government, by the way, are high despit the fact that rate are still low. can you imagin if the fed actual did push rate a hundr basi point higher over the next howev many, , months? i think that would have a real reverber effect on the consum and on the govern where deficit are still increas and they’r at high level again. no one talk about it. you have $ trillion dollar in sovereign debt and you’r about to push the five-year note abov %, which is your trigger to increas cost on fund the debt. man, the land mine are out there. i’m watch all of it. that’ what we do for our client everi singl day becaus never before, have you had to be more plug in. look at the way thing happen so much more quickli now. you ask about what’ the differ from years. so much more avail of news, quickly. but the fact of the matter is, the basic thing that we do hasn’t chang at all, which is dissect all of it, connect all the dots, and kind of tri to make it all make sens in term of what the market are do and how you might profit from that. mike gleason: well greg, thank you so much for join us again. we enjoy it veri much and love get your veri studi and experienc outlook on the state of today’ financi world. now befor we let you go, pleas tell folk about weldon financial, how they can find you, and ani other inform they should know about you and your firm. greg weldon: sure, thanks, appreci that. we’r found atweldononline.com. we do weldon live, one product, one price. it’ kind of a multi-lay product, although it’ just again, one price. we do daili and we cover daili global macro, fix income, foreign exchange, stock index and etfs, preciou and industri metals, energy, and agricultur commodities. and we tie them all togeth and we have what we call our trade lab, which is part of weldon live. these as specif trade recommend in all of those sectors, we’r old school futur guys, so that’ kind of the way we approach it. what we find is a lot of famili offic or independ broker or even individu out there, and there’ no reason with the way your see etf now be util that the averag investor can’t oper more like a hedg fund manag or cta. we tri and provid rhyme and reason to what’ go on and then specif strategi to take advantag of it. weldon live found at weldononline.com. mike gleason: well great stuff. thank so much for your time today, greg. i hope we can talk again down the road. take care and we appreci you come on. greg weldon: thanks. no problem, mike. ani time. mike gleason: well, that will do it for thi week. thank again to greg weldon of weldon financi and weldonlive. for more information, simpli go to weldononline.com and we urg everyon to sign up for a free trial there. again, you can find all of that inform at weldononline.com. be sure to check that out. mike gleason is a director with money metal exchange, a nation preciou metal dealer with over , customers. gleason is a hard money advoc and a strong propon of person liberty, limit govern and the austrian school of economics. a graduat of the univers of florida, gleason ha extens experi in management, sale and logist as well as preciou metal investing. he also put hi longtim broadcast background to good use, host a weekli preciou metal podcast sinc , a program listen to by ten of thousand each week. http://news.goldseek.com/goldseek/.php",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Debt-Driven Consumer Economy Breaking Down: Greg Weldon,John Rolls,,[''],,,

it’ hard to get folk to even agre on that. then you will have to somehow separ fact from fiction, as the report of these fact is often more hyster than historical. those who wish america a godless societi have develop a plethora of argument to support their agenda. but argument are not facts… we watch as lawyer make argument everi day, seldom concern with ani fact or even ani sens of real justice. but they can make an argument, sometim a veri success argument. if their argument is not true, ha justic been served? is the argument right if it wa made on a premis that wa all wrong, even though the argument is effective? america is and ha alway been one nation under god. though the founder use gener term like creator to describ that god, the god they meant wa their god, of the christian faith. atheist and agnost have long argu that mani of the founder were deists, use washington, jefferson, franklin, paine, hamilton, and madison as proof. however, in each of these cases, a studi of their person write will debunk the myth. how did america becom one nation under god? in dictionaries, the term “deist,” “agnostic,” and “atheist” appear as synonyms. on thi basis, the term deist would includ those who believ there is no god, those who believ in a distant, imperson creator of the univers and those who believ there is no way to know if god exists. a brief studi of the founder own write prove beyond ani reason doubt that none of the notabl founder fit thi description. thoma pain talk about “the error of schools” to teach scienc without “refer to the be who is author of them: for all the principl of scienc are of divin origin.” he state that “the evil that ha result from the error of the school in teach [scienc without god] ha been that of gener in the pupil a speci of atheism.” benjamin franklin’ plan of educ for public school in pennsylvania insist that school teach “the necess of a public religion . . . and the excel of the christian religion abov all others, ancient or modern.” franklin propos a biblic inscript for the seal of the unit states; he chose a new testament vers for the motto of the philadelphia hospital; he wa one of the chief propon of a paid chaplain in congress; and when franklin help found the colleg which bore hi name in , it wa dedic as “a nurseri of religion and learning” built “on christ, the corner-stone.” on may , , georg washington charg hi soldier at valley forg that “to the distinguish charact of patriot, it should be our highest glori to add the more distinguish charact of christian.” in a speech on may , , he claim that what children need to learn “abov all” wa the “religion of jesu christ,” and that to learn thi would make them “greater and happier than they alreadi are.” on june , , he remind the nation that “without a humbl imitation” of “the divin author of our bless religion” we “can never hope to be a happi nation”, as he resign hi post as commander-in-chief. washington’ own adopt daughter declar of washington that you might as well question hi patriot as to question hi christianity. hamilton began work with the rev. jame bayard to form the christian constitut societi to help spread over the world the two thing which hamilton said made america great: () christian and () a constitut form under christianity. onli hamilton’ death two month later thwart hi plan of start a missionari societi to promot christian government. thoma jefferson himself declared, “i am a real christian, that is to say, a discipl of the doctrin of jesus.” as presid of the unit states, jefferson sign a treati with the kaskaskia tribe wherein he provided—at the government’ expense—christian missionaries. jame madison train for ministri with the rev. dr. john witherspoon, and madison’ write are replet with declar of hi faith in god and in christ. in hi letter to attorney gener bradford, madison lament that public offici are not bold enough about their christian faith in public and that public offici should be “fervent advoc in the caus of christ.” madison did allud to a “wall of separation,” but contemporari writer frequent omit madison’ own definit of that “wall”, which accord to madison, wa onli to prevent congress from pass a nation law to establish a nation religion. there you have it… do ani of these men sound like deist to you? it is not hard to demonstr that america wa inde born one nation under god or that the god or creator they were refer to wa in fact, jesu christ. thi alon should lay to rest ani honest debat over how america becam a nation built upon judeo-christian principl and values. we can go on and on, founder after founder if you want, but these are the men name by most who argu that the founder were at best, deists. whi wa america form as one nation under god? the answer is simple, yet of vital import to everi american, regardless of their religi beliefs. the answer begin with these two words, “self-governance”. patrick henri put it thi way, “it cannot be emphas too strongli or too often that thi great nation wa found not by religionist but by christians, not on religion but on the gospel of jesu christ”. john adam said it thi way, “we recogn no sovereign but god, and no king but jesus! [april , ] and he later explained, “we have no govern arm with power capabl of contend with human passion unbridl by moral and religion. avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cord of our constitut as a whale goe through a net. our constitut wa made onli for a moral and religi people. it is wholli inadequ to the govern of ani other.”—octob , the point is thi - it is histor indisput that america wa born one nation under god. it doe not requir faith, but instead common logic to understand why. men without a moral compass are incap of long-term self-governance. the founder knew it becaus they had seen it. few modern american have experienc what life would be like in a godless society, void of morality, so they question it. mani american place their trust in man over god, so they pursu it. but there is no question what america was, is, should be or must be in order to retain it posit of strength as the freest nation of self-govern individu on earth. we will either be free as one nation under god, or we will be a nation of fool unawar of our common heritag and on the road to ruin under men in search of power. one doe not have to be a christian to understand this. one must onli understand man and hi insati hunger for power. those in search of that power must remov god from societi in order to gain access to that power. those who allow them, do so at their own peril. you are of cours free to not like thi simpl truth. but thi truth will never change. it is as it ha alway been…and shall alway be. * special thank to david barton at wallbuild for some of the refer materi use herein.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Why America Is One Nation Under God - Not a Nation of Lawyers,"Jb Williams, Because Without America, There Is No Free World.",,[''],,,

american do not like congress. even the rel apolit seem to be rous against them, with mani speak out against recent bill and congression initiatives, and phrase like, “drain the swamp!” abound on social media. shouldn’t more peopl lead to better decisions? at least when it come to government, the answer would seem to be: no. the assumpt seem to be that if we could onli get the “right” peopl in office, thing would improve. however, it would not seem that the problem is the peopl in the system, but an inher flaw in the system itself. social psycholog is not a disciplin which tend to address issu of polit organization. however, mani current polit issues, includ the recent wave of hatr for congress, can be analyz in the light of social psycholog principles, such as the classic theori of groupthink. what is groupthink? first studi by yale psychologist irv jani in the s, groupthink refer to the tendenc of group to make bad or even disastr decisions. groupthink wa first studi by social psychologist after the bay of pig when the question was: how could presid kennedy, with a cabinet of experts, have made a decis so flaw he himself would later call it “stupid?” shouldn’t more peopl lead to better decisions? at least when it come to government, the answer would seem to be: no. in hi book victim of groupthink: a psycholog studi of foreign polici decis and fiascos, dr. jani identifi three risk for groupthink’ occurrence, which are still taught in psycholog classroom today: desir for cohesiveness, structur faults, and the power of the situation. look at how congress oper today, it is not hard to see how it is inher at risk of groupthink and to understand the slew of bad/unpopular decis which seem to have becom commonplace. the three risk for groupthink occurrence: congressmen like justin amash or senat like berni sander are often tout as “rabble-rousers.” cohes the first risk for groupthink is an overwhelm desir for cohesiveness. group run the risk of groupthink when they valu uniti over make the best/eth decision. veri often, when group valu uniti too highly, they fall prey to the phenomenon of deindividuation, the forego of individu belief and principl in favor of those of the group. it no longer matter what the individu believ or want in such circumstances, it’ a matter of yield to group influence. symptom of thi desir for cohes can includ the derog of dissenters, tri to limit the question of group decisions, and the exist of mindguards, individu who ensur that dissent is kept to a minimum. it’ not hard to find exampl of these phenomena in the current polit atmosphere. congressmen like justin amash or senat like berni sander are often tout as “rabble-rousers” who don’t tow the parti line. the idea is often express that principl should take a backseat to parti uniti and parti accomplishment, which so often take the form of vote the “right way.” there are also test for parti “purity,” such as the democrats’ recent “pro-choice” test, the idea that a “real” democrat cannot be pro-life. structur fault when congressmen like rand paul have filibust in opposit to their party’ agenda, leader like john mccain attack them, impli they need to fall in line. the second risk for groupthink is structur faults, specif insul and close leadership. by be insul from outsid voic or dissent opinions, all while be subject to leadership which discourag dissent and dictat “how it is,” a group is like to doom itself to make a poor decision. congress seem to be inher insul when it come to it decision-making. in theory, congresspeopl repres their constituency’ interest at the feder level. however, most congress-peopl are not particularli in touch with their constituency. such insul is not congress’ fault, but rather a fault in design; washington is geograph isol from most of the unit states. get in touch with one’ congressperson can be nigh on impossible, especi if one is far from washington. the best-cas scenario tend to be leav messag with congression aides, but chanc for actual direct contact are low. the onli except seem to be on the campaign trail, the goal of which is not governance, but re-election. for senators, such insul can be doubli strong. with the passag of the th amendment, senat becam essenti unaccount to ani form of local govern for a major of their term of office. in theory, the direct elect of senat give local a chanc to vote them out, but it can be hard to rememb senators’ specif legisl action when elect season roll around afterward, which can take sever years. the second structur fault which increas the risk of groupthink is that of close leadership: leader who say “thi is how it is.” such leader often play the role of mindguards: quash dissent and tri to ensur that congresspeopl behav accord to the parti line rather than their own beliefs. again, it’ not hard to find instanc of thi in recent politics. when congressmen like ted cruz or rand paul have filibust in opposit to their own party’ agenda, republican leader like john mccain came out to attack them as, essentially, traitors, the implic be that they need to fall in line, their own principl be damned. the power of the situat time pressur pose a similar risk for groupthink. the third and final risk for groupthink is the power of the situation. veri often, our behavior is as much a function of our circumst as our own individuality. two situat featur increas the likelihood of groupthink: perceiv threat and time pressure. the idea of respond strongli and quickli to a threat is powerful, even evolutionarili advantageous. however, quick and strong respons are not often, if ever, the best decisions. both parti often frame their agenda in opposit to an enemy, often the opposit party. it’ a matter of “defeating” the other parti via unanim support, with no room for individu principl or beliefs. thi is how + page-long legisl get vote on immediately, with no chanc for discussion; action is required, els “they” are go to win! time pressur pose a similar risk for groupthink. the idea of have to get someth – anything! – done befor “they” can enact their sinist agenda seem to defin modern polit rhetoric. we have to pass healthcare/tax plans/net neutral immediately! meanwhile, littl chanc for elabor or discuss of these bills’ merit is given, and shockingly, the result are rare beneficial. until thi occurs, the “swamp” is go to remain, no matter who inhabit what office. reduc groupthink’ influenc mani strategi exist for combat groupthink. however, two common have emerg across most strategies: the import of dissent and provid time to examin alternatives. in the current polit climate, it is highli doubt that either of these strategi is feasibl at the feder level. congress, as it current functions, rife with partisan strife and both social and geograph insulated, doe not seem abl to resist groupthink. so what might be the solution? even at america’ birth, our founder stress the danger of a central govern gain too much power and ceas to truli repres their constituents. whatev solut is found, it is of the utmost import that they are kept in touch with those they repres and that partisan polit do not encourag legisl for the sake of unity, but rather for the sake of principle. until thi occurs, the “swamp” is go to remain, no matter who inhabit what office. source: http://freedombunker.com////draining-the-swamp-doesnt-matter-as-long-as-groupthink-persists/",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,“Draining the Swamp” Doesn’t Matter as Long as Groupthink Persists,Freedom Bunker,,[''],,,

did she pocket anything? oh, you know she did! you can be certain she did not donat her time. but then again, she’ a liber so don’t expect her to understand her own hypocrisy. it’ ok for her to “profit”, just not anyon else. one sign i have seen a lot reads: “i am a teacher!” yes, but the question is are you a good teacher and did you earn your paycheck? see, that’ the point of the test program the school’ want to institute. but the bad teacher and the union leader are so frighten that they might be found that they will not allow such things. anoth sign by the afl-cio local # reads: “on strike for better schools” well, they certainli can’t get much worse! i say stay on strike! then the school district can hire new teacher to replac the incompetent, lazi teacher with a sens of entitl who are current teach our children. that way school might actual get better! not what the unionista mean, but the truth none-the-less. then there is the crazi woman hang out of a school bu window with a sign: “student befor bankers.” huh? that’ just nonsensical. but ok, let’ go with it! the teacher’ union, i am sure, ha thi moron’ pension invest with a banker somewhere. let’ take that money away from the banker, and her, and write everi student a check instead. let them do with it as they please. if they opt to go and get an education, great! if they choos to sit around and smoke crack, so-be-it. but make them sign a waiver say they understand that there will be no futur benefit if they adopt the later approach. then when thi yummi brain decid she want to retire, she’ll no doubt rant and scream about where her money is. we will just point back to the photograph evid of her philosophi and remind her that her money, onc held by bankers, went to the student instead. oh, and by the way, consid that the strike she support left , student out of school, the sign should actual read, if it were honest, “myself befor students.” seriously, i have never seen as big a bunch of whiners! or idiot for that matter. there is someth serious wrong with the mental engrain in mani of our teacher these days. note i said “many”. i did not say “all” or even “most”. but there are mani who feel they are entitl to be teacher if they simpli want to be teachers. yet the rest of us actual have to prove ourselv compet at our profess in order to keep our jobs. and we don’t get guarante rais everi year becaus of a contract. no, we have to prove ourselv worthi everi year when evalu time roll around. i feel sorri for those teacher who are actual good teachers. there are mani of them. but the display in chicagoland give even those good teacher a bad reputation. person i would let them keep strike and hire replac teachers. we need peopl teach our children who actual want to teach. we don’t need peopl who look at the profess as a scheme to make nearli twice as much as the averag chicago resid pay their salari does.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Chicagoland: Useful Idiocy On Display,"J.J.

keep a low profil photo credit: songquan deng / shutterstock.com few news outlet are more sympathet to the financi servic industri than the wall street journal. so it’ interest when the paper report from london that “antibank sentiment here is still off the charts,” leav the industri “gun shi about flaunt wealth.” that wa also true at the olympics, even though “the game are typic one of the biggest corpor schmoozefest on the calendar.” thi is part of what the journal call “a wave of banker austerity,” with execut skip the usual “hire black sedan” and champagne, and even resort to put up import client in mere three- or four-star hotels. overall, “the citi of london’ high-rol bank industri is roll as low as possible,” in order to “avoid display of wealth that will further inflam an alreadi angri public.” so whi is the public so “inflamed” with “antibank sentiment?” recent event here and in the uk make it easi to see. . fool me times, shame on you for britons, at the top of the list stand the libor rate-fix scandal, in which the uk’ most promin bank conspir to fix a baselin interest rate that' use to calcul rate on thousand of financi product like mortgages. the scandal continu to unfold, with giant citigroup and chase still await charges, among others. but as is common in episod where major bank have commit large-scal fraud, in thi case involv hundr of billion of dollar in financi instruments, the most heavili implic bank, barclay’s, is not face legal prosecution, mere a larg fine. the new york time dealbook describ the settlement as “a multimillion dollar financi penalti and modest admiss of wrongdoing, but no crimin convict to affect it operation.” pretti gentl treatment for a firm whose traders, while work to manipul the key rate, said in email while execut the collusion: “alway happi to help;” “for you, anything;” “done…for you big boy;” and from a more conscienti employee, “i will reluctantly, gradually, and artifici get my libor in line.” especi notabl in thi connect is the conspicu absenc of bob diamond, the disgrac ex-ceo of barclay’s, from the london games, sinc diamond “had been a fixtur for year at uk events” and “had been plan to attend sever olymp event as a guest…[but] after the furor surround hi resignation, he is expect to stay away.” the bank are polit smart enough to keep their head down when they look bad. of course, the libor affair pale in it human impact when compar with other recent bank scandals, like the “robo-signing” scandal in the us. in that scam, thousand of homes, mortgag dure the hous bubbles, were foreclos upon without the requir legal stand or paperwork. the implic banks, includ the four us megabanks—bank of america, chase, citigroup and well fargo—settl the charg with the justic depart and the state for $ billion, an impress figure. however, the settlement doe littl for the real human famili evict fraudulently, includ three-quart of a million evicte who were foreclos upon from the financ crisi through the end of , most of whom receiv a check for $ each. . sanctions-bust in the fast-mov world of bank scandals, standard charter of london impress secur a spot for itself when it wa accus by a new york regul of launder a quarter trillion dollar in iranian money, in violat of us econom sanction on the country. you don’t have to support the effort of the us govern to econom strangl iran to appreci the disregard for law in compani email cite in the crimin charge, includ an execut confid that the iranian trade had “the potenti to caus veri seriou or even catastroph reput damag to the group.” standard charter settl the charg for $ million, in hope it can “avoid admit wrongdoing.” indeed, thi type of fraud is increasingli preval among the financi sector, with bank giant hsbc accus of launder mexican drug cartel money, along with cash from saudi bank with terror ties. ing bank recent spent million settl a charg that it also buck intern sanction to move cuban and iranian money. these above-the-law moves, while possibl help the peopl of these countri against the suffoc of their economi by the us, no doubt add to the “inflamed” feel of the gener public. . one nation under fraud the power of the financi sector is such that the sec, whose job is to examin financi firm and prevent or punish fraud, ha becom notori for avoid punish firm for lying, even when deal with repeat offenders. while financi law allow seriou penalti for fraud, includ larg fine and restrict on busi practices, the sec allow “waivers” for these offens and ha grant them quit liber to the largest us banks. chase ha settl six fraud case sinc , with settlement that run into the hundr of million of dollars, but ha argu befor the sec that it ha “a strong record of complianc with secur laws.” notably, the sec justifi settl these case and issu waiver by refer to promis from the firm not to violat the law in the future. yet when the firm are taken back to court for their next act of fraud, their recidiv rare bring a stiffer penalty, as ani mere human would like receive. in fact, of these waiver issu by the regulator, nearli half go to repeat offenders, “wall street firm that had settl previou fraud charg by agre never again to violat the veri law that the sec wa now say that they had broken.” thi includ other industri giant like bank of america and also citigroup, which rack up so much fraud it final did get sanctioned. the abil of the megabank to weasel out of sanction for widespread fraud are a third reason industry’ keen to stay below the radar. . high-spe glitch further undermin confid in our financi cornerston are the recurr “glitches” in larg computer stock trade system that have lead to horrifi market swings. may saw the stock exchang lose liter trillion of dollar of valu in just sever minutes, onli to recov again within anoth minutes. august of thi year began with a similar out-of-control develop on the market, as retail trade compani knight capit group had a “technolog issue” with it brand-new autom stock-trad system. while it wa suppos to react to trade by others, the comput system instead place giant order to the point that million of erron trade were made, often at inflat prices, such that knight end up have to seek new equiti partner to stay afloat. comput algorithm-bas trade strategieslik those use by knight are anoth product of regulatori loosen over the last two decades, to the point that half of stock trade is now handl by such “high-speed” firms. to compens for the increas instabl such deregul ha brought about, the secur and exchang commiss maintain “circuit breakers” to cut off trade if the price of a particular stock behav erratically. unfortunately, these countermeasur are not activ until minut after the begin of trading, wherea knight’ algorithm began runaway trade immediately. the upshot of cours is to make financ in gener and equiti trade in particular more suspici view by the public. as the time put it, the chaotic comput trade wa “the latest black eye for the financi markets…draw renew attent to the fragil and instabl of the nation’ stock markets.” . fed by the fed notably, the bank are increasingli depend on govern action for their profits. in recent years, the central bank of the eu and the us feder reserv have engag in a somewhat desper mode of econom stimulus, “quantit easing,” where the fed buy bond from major bank in order to inject more cash into the bank system, with the goal of lower interest rate and hope increas econom growth. thi bond buy ha becom a signific profit center for the bank majors, with bond-trad incom explod shortli after each round of (mostli ineffective) monetari “stimulus.” the busi press note that “big trade bank are particularli well posit to profit when

increas the amount of busi that flow through wall street, but it also lift the price of the bond that bank hold, creat profit for the traders.” the abil of the bank industri to sustain it profit and

institut collapse, open tax revolts, one-parti hegemony, major constitut change, secessionism, authoritarianism, and alter nation border militari distress, with war against terrorist or foreign regim equip with weapon of mass destruction” the fourth turn – strauss & howe the american revolut militari conflict wa with an extern enemy. the civil war wa an intern conflict between americans. world war ii wa again an extern conflict. will the come conflict be domestic, foreign or both? everi fourth turn ha intern and extern struggl and skirmishes. loyalist battl patriot dure the american revolution. both side attempt to seek european support dure the civil war. a resolut opposit despis fdr and even sought to organ a militari coup to seiz power of the government. thi fourth turn is progress along a dual path of intern and extern clash destin to defin the event which will propel the world toward a climax and resolut of thi fourth crisi period in u.s. history. the appar slow of thi fourth turn is not unusu and the rise in the stock market in the midst of the crisi doe not allevi the dire circumst of the crisis. from it low in the stock market rose by over % by , in the midst of the great depression, befor anoth % plunge. the current fed financ stock market ralli ha driven stock up about % from the lows. stock market do not defin when a crisi ha end for the major of american becaus so few peopl own a signific amount of stock. the averag american suffer econom hardship throughout the s, just as averag american have continu to suffer econom hardship sinc . as american dealt with privat and poverti in the late s the come global conflict wa brewing. animosities, prejudic and resentments, exacerb by econom turmoil, stir militarist ambit of hubrist ruler in europ and asia. the parallel with the current intern dynam are eerie. the exact time of the chaotic danger portion of thi fourth turn is uncertain, but it can’t be escaped. “don’t think you can escap the fourth turn the way you might today distanc yourself from news, nation politics, or even tax you don’t feel like paying. histori warn that a crisi will reshap the basic social and econom environ that you now take for granted. the fourth turn necessit the death and rebirth of the social order. it is the ultim rite of passag for an entir people, requir a lumin state of sheer chao whose natur and durat no one can predict in advance.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turn https://www.theburningplatform.com////the-unbearable-slowness-of-fourth-turnings/ part in part of thi articl i provid the background regard the phase of fourth turn and where we stand nine year into thi period of crisis. i will now ponder what could happen dure the remaind of thi fourth turning. “histori offer no guarantees. obviously, thing could go horribl wrong – the possibl rang from a nuclear exchang to incur plagues, from terrorist anarchi to high-tech dictatorship. we should not assum that provid will alway exempt our nation from the irrevers tragedi that have overtaken so mani others: not just temporari hardship, but debas and total ruin. lose in the next fourth turn could mean someth incompar worse. it could mean a last defeat from which our nation innoc – perhap even our nation – might never recover.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turn the most import point to comprehend is the death of the exist social order alway occur dure the cours of a fourth turning. thu far, those constitut the deep state hierarchi have fend off their demise. they are util everi tool at their dispos to retain their wealth, power and control. as their mass media propaganda machin falters, they have redoubl their rig of financi market to promot a narr of econom recovery, while further enrich themselv and their cronies. it is clear they have reach the peak of financi manipulation, money printing, and artifici interest rate suppression. the narr is faltering. their last and final option to retain power is war. as their “everyth bubble” (stocks, bonds, real estate) inevit implodes, civil and/or global militari conflict will be util to distract the populac from their deep state domest disasters. the time for compromis is long past. there are no moder left in the polit spectrum. the mood of the countri is clearli trend toward conflict. trump, as the grey champion of thi fourth turning, ha proven to be a lightn rod of hate. he infuri hi polit opponents, the left wing media, mani in hi own party, foreign leaders, billionair and most worrisom to hi well-b – the shadowi surveil state intel operatives. hi own fbi and cia have been subvert hi presid and attempt to initi hi impeach or as a last resort – coup. after run a campaign champion a reduct in foreign militari intervent in the middl east, reduc commit to nato and increas cooper with russia, it appear trump ha been taken into a room and told the militari industri complex call the shots. trump ha clearli made a self-preserv decis to avoid be jfk’d. the possibl of global catastroph is not taken serious by the vast major of americans. it’ been over seventi year sinc the last global conflict and most of the peopl who experienc the horror are dead. we’v forgotten the past and are condemn to reliv it, just as we do everi eighti or so years. the lack of volatil in financi market portend drastic level of volatil as the percept market can’t fall ha lure wall street someth mba and the investor class into a sens of invincibility. geopolit tension have been rise dramat over the last few years, with religi extremism, oil, petro-dollar, histor rivalri and nation drive the world toward conflict. these extrem econom and geopolit stress are coincid along the same timelin and will erupt simultaneously, catalyz the climact half of thi fourth turning. “the risk of catastroph will be veri high. the nation could erupt into insurrect or civil violence, crack up geographically, or succumb to authoritarian rule. if there is a war, it is like to be one of maximum risk and effort – in other words, a total war. everi fourth turn ha regist an upward ratchet in the technolog of destruction, and in mankind’ willing to use it.” – strauss & howe – the fourth turn with the hous of saud descend into mad as religi zealots, kings, princes, and foreign infiltr vie for control of their deplet oil riches, and ten of billion in high tech weaponri provid by american arm dealers, a middl east conflagr is a certainty. iran ha been win the proxi war in syria, iraq, and yemen. saudi arabia and israel are determin to stop iran’ expans at ani cost. mix religi extremism, oil riches, ga pipelines, opium, egotist dictators, nuclear bombs, hatr and territori ambit into the deepen militarist global mood chang is destin to spark a chain reaction of unintend consequ and unyield responses. the next middl east war will not be a proxi war. it will be a fight to the death. you need a scorecard to figur out the alliances, oppon and wildcards. iran appear to be align with iraq, qatar, syria, hezbollah, yemen, and russia. saudi arabia appear to be align with israel, uae, and the unit states. variou factions, who includ turkey, isis, al qaeda, and the kurds, are fight one or more of these parties. in mani case the enemi of my enemi is my friend applies. peac and compromis are out of the question at thi point. it’ just a matter of who pull the trigger to kick off the fireworks. it look like saudi arabia is will to gambl everyth on a final showdown with iran. onc the shoot start and the u.s. and russia are suck in, all bet are off on what happen next. diplomaci will not be an option. thi scenario presum a korean conflict doesn’t happen first. with reckless action on the part of kim jung un and reckless rhetor from both sides, the odd of a korean conflict are the highest sinc the s. with three carrier group sit off the korean coastline, just one provoc act or mistak could unleash a fusillad from both sides, kill hundr of thousand in a matter of days. global treaties, allianc and econom realiti are push global power in unforeseen directions, just as thi fourth turn enter it most danger phase. human fail are the constant throughout history. but, human fail result in , death dure the american revolut crisis. they could result in hundr of million of death dure thi crisis. the u.s. and europe’ provoc action with nato forc surround russia, the ongo ukrain civil war, the syrian civil war, and fals accus of rig the u.s. presidenti elect have push russia into a closer allianc with china. saudi arabia ha also strengthen tie with china, as the debt financ shale oil boom ha lessen u.s. purchas of opec oil. the eu is fall apart, as debt creation ha fail to reviv economies, govern are bankrupt, muslim hord destroy their social fabric, and a revolutionari spirit is in the air. germany, france, sweden and most of europ have sign their own death warrant by allow their countri to be invad by million of young muslim men intent on destroy their way of life. global disord is expand exponenti and is sure lead toward war. war will either be the trigger for the forthcom financi crash or a direct result of the forthcom financi crash. the core element of thi fourth turn (debt, civic decay, global disorder) are go to juxtapos and connect, acceler into a chain reaction of chaos, civil uprising, global war, mass casualties, the fall of empires, and ultim the destruct of the exist social order (aka deep state). when american see their wealth vapor for the rd time in less than two decad by the same crimin banker and corrupt politicians, they will not forgive, forget and bail them out again. they will seek out the guilti and make them pay through street justice. the fraudul deep state control scheme is beyond redempt and must be destroy in order for a constitut base free market system to be reintroduced. the result could also be dictatorship or worse. the outcom will be determin by the action we take as citizens. with a debt inund global economi alreadi slowing; panick central banker begin to take their foot off the accelerator; massiv overvalu stock, bond and real estat markets; consum in debt up to their eyeballs; stagnant wages; rise inflation; currenc and trade war heat up; deficit rise again; and gridlock legisl bodies, the onset of war in the middl east would caus oil price to skyrocket and trigger the stock market collaps .. at thi point, even the slightest hint of wage inflat caus interest rate to rise even modestli would prompt a market meltdown. the perfect storm is head our way. the tripl threat of debt, civic decay and global disord cannot be avoided. we can’t defi the chao set in motion by the cyclic natur of history. the season cannot be reversed, so we must brace ourselv for the oncom storms. “the future’ uncertain and the end is alway near.” – jim morrison “no one here get out alive.” – jim morrison there are no guarante or certainti regard what happen over the remain decad or so of thi fourth turning. don’t believ god will exempt our empir from the tragedi that have befallen past empires. debas and total ruin are not inconsequenti possibilities. hubris, arrogance, decadence, and debt have devast previou global empir and are present today in copiou quantiti as the american empir enter it critic threshold of nation survival. there are a myriad of intern and extern compet forc which threaten both the statu quo and veri exist of our nation. there will be moment of extrem danger and sever threat in the come years. i do not consid the russian peopl or the chines peopl my enemies, but my govern will attempt to convinc us to go to war against them, in order to maintain their empire. human natur ha not chang over the cours of history, but the technolog advanc in warfar have place the abil to obliter the planet into the hand of weak mind malevol men, whose egot and thirst for power know no bounds. human flaw and frailti could endang the world and it inhabitants. do you trust the leadership of your countri to do what’ in your best interest? i do not trust my government. i do not trust the puppet politician front men for the deep state. i do not trust the mega-corpor who domin our economy. i do not trust central banker and their wall street owners. i do not trust the fake news corpor media. i do not trust the militari industri complex. i do not trust the leader of organ religion. i trust my own instincts, reason ability, and critic think skills. i trust my immedi famili members. i trust some of my neighbors. i trust more of peopl i’v met through my blog than i’v met face to face. i trust normal peopl live normal live across thi onc great country. i trust the peopl who distrust the peopl and thing i distrust. as event spiral out of control, we will need to pick and choos our friend carefully. if or when the govern attempt to forc my three son into a war on behalf of the vest interest to retain their wealth and power, i will resist with everi ounc of strength in my age body. they will not becom cannon fodder for the deep state. we don’t know the event and path which will drive the remaind of thi crisis, but we do know our choic will matter. thi is no time for apathi and complacency. for those who grasp gener theori and the cycl of history, the seemingli unbear slow of thi fourth turn is actual a blessing. the slow allow more time to prepare. if you haven’t prepar for the come saecular winter, time is grow short. the sky are darkening. our rendezv with destini awaits. “reflect on what happen when a terribl winter blizzard strikes. you hear the weather warn but probabl fail to act on it. the sky darkens. then the storm hit with full fury, and the air is a howl whiteness. one by one, your link to the machin age break down. electr flicker out, cut off the tv. batteri fade, cut off the radio. phone go dead. road becom impossible, and car get stuck. food suppli dwindle. day to day vestig of modern civil – bank machines, mutual funds, mass retailers, computers, satellites, airplanes, govern – all reced into irrelevance. pictur yourself and your love one in the midst of a howl blizzard that last sever years. think about what you would need, who could help you, and whi your fate might matter to anybodi other than yourself. that is how to plan for a saecular winter. don’t think you can escap

(mi apolog for the stupid error in my last column date the constitut as .) we may have to face thi real crisi again, but won’t have to write new document thi time. we need onli to enforc the one we alreadi have - the one that the obama regim is determin to ignor or overrule. when our found father declar their independ from the king of england, they claim “taxat without representation.” today we are be victim and oppress by the obama regim for the same reason. our money is be taken and noth we want is be provid in return. on the contrary, they are use it for thing we emphat oppose, and strap our citizen with unconscion debt. they are grab everi dollar and everi ounc of credit they can to spend thi countri into insolvency. now they want to increas the nation debt ceil from . trillion to trillion just to cover the entitl program alreadi on the book until after the come novemb elections, in spite of obama‘ statement on the senat floor: “rais america’ debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.” the current nation debt is at . trillion, and at the current rate of spending, the . trillion ceil will be reach in january. ad anoth trillion to the debt ceil would last onli until month befor the next election. that wouldn’t be good for democrat re-elect chanc so if they increas it now by . trillion, they hope no one will notic or if they do, they won’t rememb next november. thi addit debt should last until the end of , well after the elections. the socialist have done nothing, absolut nothing, to reduc the budget, the nation debt, or their spending. even the tarp loan payback money that bank have repaid to the govern - which wa suppos to go back into the treasuri to help reduc the deficit - ha been stolen by the obama regim and divert to hi govern job creation program. or in other words, to hi environment and union support and other special interest lobbies. moody’ investor servic say the u.s. and u.k. may loos their triple-a credit rate by “if econom growth lags, interest rate rise and the govern fail to shrink the deficit or recov it loan to the financi sector.” obama profess that he can solv the problem of govern overspend with dramat increas in govern overspending. he pride himself on remov $ million from a $. billion wast spend bill. thi is insane. so in a year from now, when the debt reach trillion, what then? just do it again? where doe it end? what is the end game? when will the goal of a cloward-piven financi collaps final be realized? will it happen befor the next election? how long will it be befor thi imit presid declar to the countri that the govern ha no choic but to take over all privat sector busi and industry, and consequ redistribut the wealth, in order to “save the country” - or is it to “save the planet?” closer to the truth would be to secur perman polit power for the socialist left. if you haven’t recogn it by now, that is the end game. we call it communism. we now have two system work against each other: a govern socialist system compet against the privat sector capitalist system. who will hold these tyrant account to the constitut and to the people? onli the voter can, if it’ not too late by next novemb and in . unfortunately, thi regim ha nearli a half trillion dollar of our money unspent from tarp and stimulu to use as they wish to make sure that doesn’t happen. those who laid our constitut foundat were veri clear about it limit on government. our constitution’ principl author, jame madison, wrote, “the power deleg by the propos constitut to the feder govern are few and defin and will be exercis princip on extern objects, as war, peace, negoti and foreign commerce.” concern the legislature’ authority, thoma jefferson asserted: “give congress a distinct and independ power to do ani act they pleas which may be good for the union, would render all the preced and subsequ enumer of power complet useless. it would reduc the whole constitut to a singl phrase, that of institut a congress with power to do whatev would be for the good of the unit states; and as sole judg of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatev evil they please. certainly, no such univers power wa meant to be given them. the constitut wa intend to lace them up straightli within the enumer power and those without which, as means, these power could not be carri into effect.” madison added, “if congress can do whatev in their discret can be done by money, and will promot the gener welfare, the govern is no longer a limit one, possess enumer powers, but an indefinit one, subject to particular exceptions.” if you quot these vers to those in power today, they would think you were nuts. madam pelosi as much as said so when ask to state constitut author for her healthcar bill. other in congress had similar reaction and none could answer the question. the don’t believ in the constitut or the limit it place on their powers. thi is not the govern creat by our found father - thi is not the govern the american peopl want. the replac constitut these peopl are creat is not the constitut our arm forc are sworn to protect and defend. when did hugo chavez becom presid of the unit state under the name of barack obama? whose side will the militari be on when push come to shove? i think they well know who support them and who doesn’t. and they know the constitut they swore an oath to defend. americans, check your freedom at the door - it will not be return to you. we must stop thi mad now!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Liberalitis: The Reckless Spending and Despotic Disease In Washington,"Jr Dieckmann, Because Without America, There Is No Free World.",,[''],,,

programs, like affirm further fair housing, or common core they conduct sophist and often decept market campaign that cover up there downsides. floweri slogan like, “transport option are fundament to have a shot at the american dream,” and “econom divers is the path to better outcom for all american children,” may sound moving. the truth about the program is often disturbing. the depart of educ (used) and dot use the abov phrase to market a feder scheme to region and densifi commun by shuffl student to new commun in the name of “incom diversity.” (id is the government’ buzzword for a student’ path to success.) whether their program are to “protect the environment”, (region sustain development,) develop “colleg and career ready” children (common core,) or creat a platform to “improv adult outcomes” (hud’ affh,) agenc pump up the benefit to the uniniti public, with littl regard for the destruct effect of their plans. if a privat busi engag in similar decept practic as our government, the consum financi protect bureau would probabl fine them out of business. unfortunately, consum have littl protect against feder dishonesty. with a dysfunct congress and a disturbingli power executive, it is up to inform citizen work with local public offici to protect our own interests. here are four common way our govern deceiv the american people. cherry-pick report when feder agenc start project the public may reject, they often cite research studi prove the wisdom and import of their program. thi “research” also demonstr the agency’ profession and due diligence. but their studi often are littl more than weak justif for program that frequent caus more harm than benefit to commun and to the intend beneficiaries. one exampl is hud’ “move to opportunity” (mto), a reviv “random social experiment,” that transfer low-incom famili into higher incom area to improv access to better educ and jobs. a hud report reveal the mto program did reduc the incid of “extrem obesity” and “major depression” among the random families. but, accord to the analysis, after years, the project “fail to improv education, employ or incom outcomes.” food stamp usag rose and, “male in the experiment group were arrest more often than those in the control group, primarili for properti crimes, and were also more like to engag in a varieti of other delinqu and riski behaviours.” the blatant failur did not dissuad hud who ha now reintroduc the program. sinc , a seri of new studi micro-analyz the origin results, each find a posit nugget among the dismal results. finally, an august report, “effect of exposur to better neighborhoods”, conclud that, under mto, children below the age of earn more money, were more like to attend college, and the girl were less like to becom singl mothers. the “groundbreaking” studi virtual ignor the neg from the origin research and wast few sentenc on the plight of children over who report “lower incomes” and wors outcom than had they never moved. hud offici also disregard the report’ most critic observ that, “the mto experiment design cannot be use to conclus establish that childhood exposur to a better environ ha a causal effect on long-term outcomes…” hud is proceed with a program that, after years, research can show no conclus proof works. there are broader concerns. the administr ignor aggress pursuit of method to reduc the incid of singl parent families, and increas local educ opportunities, even though research recogn both as solut to improv educ outcom that are more import than incomes. is hud even within it legal bounds? hud is advanc the mto program under it affirm further fair hous rule. yet, noth in the fair hous act entitl hud to transfer peopl to gain incom integration, nor engag in mani of the action they are take under affh. continu below... hear no research, see no research hud and the depart of educ believ poor student perform is primarili the result of live in concentr area of poverty. to remedi this, the agenc intend to reloc low-incom famili to better neighborhood to improv educ and incom outcomes. to a low-incom family, thi seem like a boon. who would not want to move to a nicer area, especi if someon els is pay for it? but, to conclud that move to affluent area is the best solut to improv outcomes, hud had to ignor volum of research find that prove locat is not the prime driver of scholast ability. move famili to locat where adult and children have no friend or rel in area they cannot afford, bring it own challenges. the study, “the effect of poverti on academ achievement” conclud that incom and a mother’ level of educ are the signific factor in determin educ outcomes. “in mani studies, mother’ educ had a more signific effect on children’ score than income.” the author’ recommend that “instruct techniqu and strategi can help close the achiev gap by provid student with necessari assist in order to achiev high standard in academ performance.” there is no recommend to uproot famili and move them to more affluent areas. a study, sponsor by the prestigi harvard program on educ polici and governance, and educ next, reveal that a child’ educ disadvantag are more the result of their parents’ educ level than where they live. “among student from famili with low parent education, u.s. literaci profici is a disastr percent, far below the percent mark reach by student with high parent education.” while pursu incom diversity, hud ignor that the best way to improv grade and opportun is not to shuffl famili into new neighborhoods, but to educ famili about the import of two-par households, the effect of father on children’ education, and the valu of educ for all famili members. instead, hud, dot and the depart of educ are move ahead with region equiti assist center as part of presid obama’ stronger togeth program, (see page ) to teach local educ how to attain incom divers in classroom as a mean to improv educ outcomes. twist logic econom mobil is the reason behind one of the administration’ most aggress program to reloc low-incom famili into better areas. it sound reasonable, but ignor the real caus of econom immobl and depriv the next gener of the mental tool necessari to compet and succeed. econom mobil is the abil of individu to move up and down the earn ladder. greater mobil is associ with job opportunities, wealth accumul and person freedom. at one time, american easili migrat from the poor to the middl class, but sinc the ’s thi ha slow until today, the u.s. is one of the least econom mobil of all first world nations.th main caus for our immobl are technolog advanc that reduc the need for mani middl incom positions; and more importantly, a recess recoveri that ad high pay job for the upper class, and servic orient work for low-incom brackets, but littl for the middl class. with fewer middl class opportunities, the poor are stuck with nowher to advance.th administr is right to conclud that econom mobil is a factor of success. but that success requir organ mobility, not feder mandat mobility. desiring, strive and overcom whatev disadvantag there may be is all part of the success model.to help poor famili improve, hud-used-dot want to reloc schoolchildren in the elementari and secondari grade to gain econom divers in each classroom. in an accompani program, small area fair market rents, hud famili will find their section voucher reduc in lower incom zip code and rais in wealthier neighborhoods, forc them to move to more affluent areas, regardless of their wishes.th presid tout thi misguid program as “fundamental” to children’ success. the rational is akin to the absurd conclus that, “well-to-do famili drive bmw’s, therefore, if we buy beamer for low-incom families, they too will share the success of the higher earners.” under thi logic, you could even provid a studi prove that the owner of their new subsid bmw’ are more psycholog content, arriv at work faster, and return home earli enough to spend more qualiti time with the famili and help the kid with their schoolwork. you can fool some of the people, all of the time govern agenc frequent mislead local public offici and the public by includ word in their document that impli the opposit of what the regul actual accomplishes. a case in point is the administration’ affirm further fair hous rule that util the fair hous act to elimin segreg and discrimination. while thi seem like a good cause, in practice, the program doe littl to elimin discrimination. it doe impos aggress oversight over commun planning. dure the regulatori comment period for affh, astut respond question hud’ “intrus into local affair and responsibilities,” particularli zoning. the agenc releas thi comfort statement: “thi rule doe not impos ani land use decis or zone law on ani local government.” (see page ) but the statement is deceptive. while hud doe not directli impos land use decis or zone laws, indirectli they can forc you to impos them. as thi commun discovered, through charg of failur to affirm further fair housing, civil right violations, threat to withdraw grant money and other legal actions, hud can coerc commun into complianc with their zone requirements, even when the voter disagree. it would be nice to think the agenc onli use their author in the face of flagrant civil right violations. that is not the case. in westchest counti ny, in spite of be on-track to meet a court settlement requir the counti build new afford homes, the hud affili monitor want each commun to adopt “model zone ordinances.” at one point, the agenc notifi counti execut rob astorino that ¼ acr build plot repres “exclusionari zoning,” becaus low-incom famili cannot afford them. as hud expand their authority, they also expand their interpret of what constitut segreg and discrimination, leav commun who accept grant in a tenuou position. these are onli a hand of feder program that cost taxpay million of wast dollars. program like the econom recoveri and reinvest act, afford care act and common core have many, mani time thi waste, intent misrepresent and flaw outcomes. more than the money, our govern is usurp the right of

fortunately, in earli wa at least temporarili resolved, and oil flow have return to normal sinc then. newer technolog boost iraqi output as of , iraqi oil product is alreadi benefit from new technolog which had been unavail dure the year of the un trade embargo. dure the past few year these newer technolog have been introduc into iraq by the intern oil compani that have been use such method to increas oilfield yield in other countries. given iraq’ huge reserves, the nation’ oil industri will certainli to gain the maximum benefit from these technologies. the most import new technolog are direct drill and hydraul fracturing, both of which promis to help boost iraqi product and export significantly. direct drill befor the s, most well were drill vertically. that is, a hole wa drill straight downward until it reach oil, or not. then, in sever drill compani develop techniqu for slant drilling, which wa an earli form of direct drill that allow the hole to be drill at a slight angle. direct drill equip allow a drill bit to move in a curv line rather than a straight line, so it can snake it way around underground obstacl such as unusu hard rock formations. in fact, given enough depth, well can be drill horizontally, that is, parallel to the surfac of the land above. the first practic benefit of direct drill is that it allow driller to reach oil reservoir sever mile away from the site of the drill rig. current technolog allow driller to drill as far as mile away laterally. so, for example, direct drill allow land-bas rig to drill in offshor locations, which significantli reduc product expenses. and, oil locat under steep mountain can likewis be tap from nearbi flatlands. most importantli in iraq, direct drill allow produc to increas the length of underground pipe expos to the reservoir. instead of simpli have the veri end of the pipe insert into an oil reservoir, with direct drill a fairli long perfor section of the pipe is place in contact with the oil. thi is critic import for ensur high flow onc a well is completed, sinc oil can be suck in through a much larger surfac area. in iraq direct drill enabl produc to overcom the sluggish flow which had result from saddam’ polici of over-draw oil from well and then reinject thick, undesir residu back into the ground in hope of obtain short-term increas in flow, as mention above. and, direct drill also make it possibl for multipl wellhead to draw oil from a singl drill site, so the extend length of perfor pipe expos to the oil in the reservoir mean greater yields. likewise, direct drill also allow a singl wellhead to draw oil and/or ga from within sever differ geolog strata (layer of rock) at differ depths, someth which is imposs with older perpendicular drill methods. the introduct of direct drill technolog ha help iraq dramat increas it production, and these technolog hold the promis of even greater yield in the future. hydraul fractur hydraul fracturing, sometim also call fracking, is a method for stimul well to produc more oil. the effect of frack wa discov dure a seri of experi in , and the first commerci applic came in . although some commun in the u.s. have debat the use of frack for our domest production, in iraq the practic is a potenti godsend becaus it may allow oil produc to significantli increas their wells’ outputs. water contain a suspens of sand and other constitu is inject under high pressur down into a well in order to creat crack in the oil-bear rock. these crack allow oil to flow more freeli within the underground reservoir, and therefor more can be extracted. a hydraul fractur is creat underground by pump the fractur fluid into the wellbor in order to increas the underground pressur enough to crack rock. as the rock cracks, the fractur fluid continu onward, extend the crack further and further. frack equip can oper at pressur and flow rate of up to , pound of pressur per squar inch (psi) with inbound flow of frack fluid as high as barrel per minute. sand and other materi call proppant are ad to the frack fluid in order to “prop open” the crack alreadi created, so they won’t close while the oil is flow outward. these propped-open fractur allow oil and ga trap within rock to more easili flow outward. it’ been estim that frack increas oil product by an averag of about %, and natur ga product by an averag of %. most importantly, when use togeth frack and direct drill have a synergist effect – the yield with both togeth may be substanti higher than if each were use separately. the outlook given it huge oil reserv and the long-term commit by intern oil compani to develop it oil and ga fields, iraq is certain to have a bright econom future. as measur by it ever-increas volum of oil exports, the country’ oil industri ha fulli recov from the damag and mismanag that it suffer dure saddam hussein’ reign. notwithstand iraq’ already-known reserves, it seem like that recent new explor effort by oil compani will lead to an even greater talli of iraq’ oil wealth. it’ also import to note that iraq isn’t just bless with larg reserves, it also happen that the geolog format hold iraq’ oil are much more access to drill than they are in most countries, which mean the cost of extract that oil are much lower. thi is signific becaus iraq can profit produc petroleum at price of less than $ per barrel. in contrast, u.s. shale oil cost between $ to $ per barrel to produce, and even the most cost-effect well in texa gener requir a global oil price of at least $ per barrel in order to be profitable. so, iraq can afford to pump and sell oil at price below those of most other produc nations. these product advantag have been visibl dure the recent saudi arabian oil-product war design to bankrupt u.s. shale-oil producers. while oil produc in the u.s. and elsewher have been sever impact by the saudis’ overproduction, iraq continu to produc profitably. oil drive the iraqi dinar given the world’ insati appetit for oil and gas, iraq’ domin suppli role is like to becom even stronger go forward. although it’ difficult to predict the futur with certainty, it seem like that sometim in the near futur iraq will grow into a region and intern energi super-pow base on it rich reserves. in fact, iraq seem on-track to replac saudi arabia as the region’ wealthiest, most-develop nation within the next few years. what doe thi mean for the dinar? a nation’ economy, as well as the valu of it currency, depend on it natur resources. iraq’ except larg oil reserv are like “money in the bank,” avail to meet the young democracy’ need as it continu to grow. eventu the valu of the iraqi dinar should rise to reflect the true valu of the country’ oil wealth. thi seem likeliest to occur onc the central bank of iraq (cbi) free the dinar from the artificially-low valu place on it in follow the darkest day of saddam hussein’ regime. when that occurs, the strength of iraq’ economi will rapidli becom obviou to all observ worldwide, not simpli those few individu who have taken the time to research it. in ani event, knowledg is the key to success. to learn more about the statu of the iraqi oil industri and how it

blockchain stock are next! author by turd ferguson via tfmetalsreport.com as mention at the begin of thi podcast, we are all indebt to john and steve for their regular, weekli discussions. their podcast offer the onli fair and balanc coverag of the new cold war that you will find anywher in the western media. rather than a simpl regurgit of the war parti line, john and steve consid the conflict from the histor perspect of each side. thus, in listen to them over the past four years, i almost feel as if i have particip in a graduate-level russian studi class. download podcast (right click + ‘save as’) to be certain that thi discuss is as widely-heard as possible, i’v taken the addit step of transcrib portion of the audio. we begin with professor cohen provid some histor background regard ukraine, russia and the run-up of thi new cold war. i’v been work in print and broadcast about the onset of a new cold war sinc late s becaus i saw the clinton administration’ intrus polici and then yeltsin’ russia as gener a backlash that would lead the two countri to a replic or continu of the -year cold war that reagan and gorbachev and then the first presid bush said they had end in - and that ha unfold more or less in the worst way that i worri about. i don’t think anybodi would deni that they we’r in a new cold war. i think they’r slow in acknowledg that it’ even more danger in variou way and reason than wa the -year cold war. but one reason is thi wa not the case dure the old cold war is that we are militarili eyeball-to-eyebal with russia and on three new cold war fronts. one, of course, is ukrain which in a way is the epicent but becaus of nato’ i think reckless militari buildup on russia’ western border particularli in the baltic region region but also to a certain extent in syria where the situat is veri fluid and still dangerous. the cold war could erupt into an actual hot war veri easily. and i guess though the danger seem mayb a year ago would be first and foremost in syria becaus ukrain sinc seem rather frozen. now it’ shift back to ukraine. we’v got to stop and think what that means. ukrain as a nation and then as a state follow the end of the soviet union in wa alway fraught with histor religious, ethnic, economic, and polit divisions. simpli hold ukrain togeth as a unitari state wa go to be a problem but everyon managed. it wasn’t pretti but they manag until the event of when we all rememb the maidan protest and let’ rememb what they were about…th legally-constitut elect presid of ukraine, viktor yanukovych, declin to sign a so-cal european union partnership agreement. it wa just said to be civiliz and econom and it wa said that that would bring ukrain into european civil and of cours away from russia. now ukrain and russia had been bound at the hip. peopl don’t mention thi often but there are ten of million of intermarriages. it’ hard not to go to moscow and spend some time and not find someon who’ got a ukrainian and russian parent or grandparent. but thi happen and it also need to be remov remind that yanukovych did not refus to sign that agreement. he simpli ask for more time. but that set off protest driven by all sort of people. some benign democrat seek liberals, fine peopl in ukraine, but also by peopl who were by ani definit ultra-nationalist and even quasi-fascist neo-nazis. and that led of cours to the confront where yanukovych wa driven illeg off. a new, illeg govern wa form back by the unit state and europe. russia for variou reason that i think were legitim fear that the unrest would spread to the histor russian peninsula of crimea which for most of it histori for centuri had been part of russia. but becaus of a kind of fluke, wa now territori part of ukraine. the russian therefor welcom and encourag a referendum in crimea. by all standard includ gallup poll that were taken later, more than percent vote to join russia. and so russia legal annex in …they don’t call it annex, they call it reunit with crimea. meanwhile, the mostli russian provinc of donbass, part of crimea object to the coup in kiev that had overthrown the president. they had vote for yanukovych. hi elector wa not onli in southeastern ukrain but it wa primarili there. so they believ that their presid had been overthrown and a rebellion began back by russia of course. and the war ha gone on now nearli four years. the offici number of dead is , but it’ sure mani more and perhap million peopl who live in southeastern ukrain have been displac most of them gone to russia. incidentally, russia get no credit for the veri humanitarian way they have handl all these people, refuge who fled to russia. now of cours it wa easier becaus they were russian speakers. but a great mani of them have rebuilt their lives. vocat and in term of their famili in russia. and whether they’ll ever go back to ukrain is not clear. so that’ where the situat wa kind of frozen. there wa thi agreement as you know call the minsk agreement that all the european power agre to there. the presid of ukraine, poroshenko, agre to it and that putin agre too for resolut of the crisis. and it call for two things…a cessat along a design line of the fight and kiev’ agreement that donbass would be given home rule. to remain within what would essenti be a feder ukrainian state. no one ha ever suggest a better or altern solut to that. dure the year sinc minsk wa formal in , by all evid it seem both side have violat the agreement. but kiev ha refus to grant ani home rule to the rebel provinc and that we know from histori whether it’ from the irish civil war or other divers countri is the onli way to save a state is to make it a federation. but the opposit to it in ukrain among ultra-right is enormous. presid poroshenko is weak both as a person and as a leader and in term of hi public support at home. the unit state ha done noth to encourag the real implic of minsk. and so it remain thi hot front. and one could imagin all sort of bad outcom becaus it’ now a proxi war in donbass that is the rebel were back by russia. kiev is back by the unit state and that proxi war could becom a direct war. and a final point and thi ha been long wind but when is that ever sinc obama wa tri to figur out what to do about ukraine. the idea of the unit state send more and higher qualiti weapon to kiev. to presum suppress the rebellion in donbass though formal it said to ward off a new russian attack of which there is no evid or intention. obama refus to do it (send heavi weapons). he wa under enorm pressur especi from the liber wing of the democrat parti which ha becom veri hawkish and he refus to do that. it seem clear from donald trump’ campaign that he would never do it becaus he want to cooper with russia. and yet he ha been compel i think to agre to send weapon to kiev when and what they’ll send isn’t yet clear but he can onli make matter wors realli matter worse. and that’ where we are today. the discuss then turn to the present day. the narr in the west is that russia seiz crimea as some sort of post-soviet expansion, where putin must be stop as he is desper tri to recreat the border of the old soviet union. at tfmr, we have alway felt that thi wa bogu and that it fail to acknowledg ani context from the russian point of view. professor cohen resumes: the situat from the russian point of view wa even worse. i mean crimea…and for to understand thi you have to know russian history, know russian and know crimea…crimea historically, cultur wa such a part of russia for so mani centuri right through the soviet period that it would be….thi is a bit of a stretch as if to say that texa becaus it onc belong to mexico…wa not authentically, indigen a nativ part of america. but even more becaus the cultur romanc of crimea. the site, i mean the home of chekov’ dacha wa in yalta. it’ icon in russian history, russian cultur and russian sentiment. it wasn’t just the naval base at sebastopol which wa vital important, although the russian which had been leas the naval base and by the way what happen at maidan call into question whether kiev would honor that long term leas ani longer. you’r absolut right about that. russia wa build in the far north an altern naval base. i mean technic it could have replic crimea strateg it could have done thi but it could never have replic crimea in the heart and mind of russians. and, as poll after poll and the referendum show in the heart and mind of some percent of the crimean people. now crimea also ha tartar crimean and ukrainian who don’t share thi view. but the overwhelm major of crimean who were born there or move there or live there for decades, that wa their sentiment. now here’ the polit background. nonetheless in all the year i’v follow post soviet russia, begin in , i never saw ani kremlin leadership give ani indic that it wa go to take crimea back. let me repeat that. you could not find, certainli not in the public record…who know what…dreams…y know these kind of peopl have in the pentagon and elsewher secretli in the dark of the night. but neither yeltsin nor putin ever gave ani public support to the idea which you could find in moscow and some intellectu circl that you know, crimea is ours. in fact, at one point they need to draw new map becaus crimea wa now no longer in russia after . and putin wrote to the presid of crimea…i don’t recal which one it wa say “hey our map peopl want to get on with the new map could you get your map peopl to work with them becaus there’ a number of border that aren’t clear and we’v got to clarifi them”. and he got no response. in other words, the notion that crimea might be taken or even negoti back into russia simpli wa not on the polit agenda for the kremlin under putin until . the final segment of the discuss deal with the futur . + more specifically, what if anyth can be done by you and i…regular everyday people…to effect chang and divert the war parti from thi path of destruction? professor cohen had some thought there, too. i’m not a trump support and i didn’t vote for him. however, we can actual support donald trump’ campaign promis which i think he’ tri to act on sinc he’ been presid that it’ necessari to cooper with russia. thi is what wa call detent in the th century. i don’t know whi trump doesn’t make thi point. i don’t think he ha veri good advisor in regard to russia either in term of what’ go on in russia or in term of hi own polici make but trump might say in hi own defens becaus they’r indict him for simpli say i want to cooper with russia and with putin in particular. he could say look, everi republican presid of consequ in the th centuri pursu detent with russia. first eisenhower, the first detent the spirit of camp david with khrushchev, then the nixon kissing attempt at a grand detent with brezhnev and final abov all ronald reagan a detent with gorbachev the last soviet leader soviet russian leader so great that reagan and gorbachev end the cold war. trump could put himself in that tradit and say “i’m the tradit republican. thi is what eisenhower, nixon and reagan did. they did it wisely. they avoid nuclear war with russia. we’r in a new cold war. the danger are grave. it’ not onli my duti as the american presid to pursu cooper to ward off a catastroph but i commend the honor tradit of the republican party”. he doesn’t say that. i don’t know whi as i say it becaus he doesn’t know what or becaus he want to be the one and onli i have no idea what he need to say. and if he said it it would compel a convers in washington that we’r not having. what’ happen to detent and what’ happen is we have if we ignor hi own idiom and put it in again i speak as a stori in the histor languag of th centuri diplomacy. we have a pro-detent presid who for the first time in histori is not permit to at least tri becaus everi time he ha a sensibl convers with putin, no matter whether it’ face to face or on the telephone, he’ accus not onli by the tradit crazi in american polit but by the new york time of treason. so what we could do and it will be hard for a lot of peopl becaus of the loath for trump. is so pervas just and i didn’t vote for trump is the fifth amend i didn’t vote for trump and i didn’t support presid trump. but about thi he is not onli right. he’ our onli hope at the moment. so one possibl is simpli to say no matter all els we support donald trump’ attempt to cooper with russia becaus it’ existential. now would enough of us do that would a few newspap do that? would a few of these cabl tv panelists? would they ever have panelist on who would do that? we might affect a littl civic courag in congress where a few peopl there would do so also. but at the moment you have a complet blackout on thi perspect in the american polit media arena and you have an utter lack of civic courag among polit figur and editor who know better but have been frighten by thi rush to do busi unfortun and that’ a pretti good summation. obviously, at minutes, there’ a lot more inform here than what i’v transcribed. therefor i beg you, pleas take the time thi weekend to listen to

unfortunately, john kerri remain true to hi appetit for power, and thu the american public remain afflict with a secretari of state who need “addit evaluation” undertaken befor he can decid if the wholesal and systemat slaughter of christian in the middl east constitut “genocide.” a man who, when inform that a former gitmo detaine had return to terrorism, epitom the utter clueless of the entir obama administration’ foreign policy. “he’ not suppos to be do that,” kerri stated. that be said, there is littl doubt in my mind that a commander-in-chief al gore or john kerri would have been wors leader by sever order of magnitude. gore had the decenc to take hi global warm hustl into the privat sector, where he made million sell christian-lik dispens known as “carbon credits” to the termin gullible. unfortun like hi father, georg w. believ maintain comiti with hi democrat detractor wa appar more import that defend the most moment decis ani commander-in-chief must make. reneg on hi no new tax pledg to accommod democrats—who savag him in return—prob cost georg h.w. bush the election. georg w.’ flaccid respons to reid and compani gave us a democratically-control congress in —and pave the way for the rise of barack obama in . let’ be clear here. thi is neither a ring endors for what bush accomplished, nor a knock on what i perceiv as hi major failings, the foremost of which wa allow democrat to co-opt the iraq war narr without ani substant pushback. when american men and women are in harm’ way, allow a slander hack like harri reid to declar the war “lost” even befor the ultim success surg wa completed, wa an unconscion and unnecessari surrender. it is pretti clear that eight year of the obama administration’ effort to “fundament transform the unit state of america” into a socialist utopian paradise, with a third world underpin that million of illeg represent, ha enrag million of americans. mayb even to the point, as so mani of trump’ critic point out, where anger and frustrat ha complet supplant anyth resembl ration thinking. anger and frustrat about what? how about a gop establish that ha made an utter mockeri of their base’ support and is now in the process of go after that base’ prefer candid with the kind of vigor and vicious they have never direct at at barack obama or hillari clinton? moreover, what in the world do they think would happen if they purpos orchestr a broker convent where none of the current presidenti candid get the nomination? they have to know that the number of conserv who stay home when milquetoast mitt “polited” hi way to defeat would be dwarf by the number who would stay home if an establish gop candid were force-f to the base. thu an inescap conclus arises: the establish gop would toler a presid hillari clinton to maintain their control of the party—even if they run the parti into the dustbin of histori as a result. that would be the same hillari clinton, who believ the rule of law appli to everyon els but her and her husband. the same hillari clinton who left four american to die in benghazi and then lie about a video be the caus of their demis when her own commun with her daughter, egyptian prime minist hisham kandil and the libyan presid on the night of the attack indic she knew otherwise. a women who still can’t explain at the veri least how highly-classifi email “migrated” from wholli secur and self-contain govern server to her person one. a woman with no discern accomplish as a senator, and a track record of coloss failur as secretari of state. a woman who success use the sexist card to bash everi republican, until trump came along and threw it right back in her predator-en face. make no mistake: thi is not an endors of donald trump. i’m not a big fan of the palookavil style of politics, or the mud-wrestl into which the republican primari season ha devolved. but if trump doe make it to the finish line, and hillari is hi opponent, then what?

the event, held at calgary’ winsport complex (aka canada olymp park), had us navig a slalom cours initially, start slowli and build up speed as we got comfortable. thank to fresh snow it wa plenti slippery, which of cours work to the benefit of the exercise, but the combin of mitsubishi’ awc system and the expert guidanc meant that veri few cone were clobbered. from there, we did an acceler and brake cours - basic a straight line between cone dure which we peel out as much as possibl on snow (surprisingli peelable, thank to the mit technology), barrel toward the brake zone, then tromp on the pedal. the first time wa kind of tentative, then we got faster and more aggress on the brake pedal to showcas not onli the outlanders’ perform but also to show us the differ between brake with and without use the anti-lock brake system. i’v alway been of the opinion that if the traction control and/or ab come on then you aren’t do your job as a driver, but sometim it’ nice to have the electron robot on hand just in case. thi is especi true these days; my first car with ab wa an origin gener infin q with first gener ab and traction control and it wa more annoy than useful, but those day appear to be long gone as technolog ha march onward. from there, we went to a “fork in the road” event where we went like a bat out of hell toward said fork - laid out again with cone - the instructor wait till the last minut to tell us if we should take the left or right fork, or stay in the middl and stand on the brakes. thi not onli taught us to listen and to pay attention, it also help showcas the benefit of look as far down the road ahead of you as possibl so you’r readi for whatev might happen in front of you. the focus, as it should be, wa on the import of smooth behind the steer wheel. not just smooth on the wheel itself, though of cours that’ critical, but smooth on the pedal as well. sure, the nanni and awc can help a lot, but the bottom line as alway is that the pilot in command is, indeed, in command and should take those respons seriously. continu below... it remind me of a line in the movi “contact,” where the young girl heroin is tri to find peopl to talk to on her ham radio. her dad tell her “small moves,” mean basic that be smooth and gentl on the tune knob would help. and it did: she end up in an alien-design space transport! it’ the same with driving. sure, there are time when a panic stop or swerv might be necessary, but the lion’ share of your time behind the wheel will be better and more effici if you keep your eye peel on the condit around you (and as far ahead as you can see) so that, if you do need to make some kind of cours correction, you can do it with smaller, more control - and smoother - moves. racer such as the morrisport guy know and practic thi and they help attende understand the concept befor unleash us to wreak our own special havoc on the snowi lot. the bottom line of the event is that it gave those of us who were there a chanc to learn about and practic - in a limit manner under control condit - optim steer wheel control, vision and anticipation, as well as some obstacl avoid and emerg brake tactic in both a straight line and on curves. you can do thi on your own on ani reason large, snow-cov park lot. sure, you may not have the expert guidanc we had dure mitsubishi’ event, or a bunch of cone to lay out, but ani practic is good practic and if you can learn to control your vehicl better by do a few donut after the mall ha close for the day, you’ll be more confid and more skill when push realli doe come to slide in the real world. besides, it’ fun!

blockchain search exceed trump! blockchain stock are next! cia refus to show evid link trump to russia becaus it would help russia! in the week subsequ after donald trump wa elect president, cia analyst who work on russia refresh their analysi about russian cyber meddling. they earlier had consid that russia wa attempt to undermin the u.s. presidenti election, but after nov. they came to assum that russian interfer wa truli creat to help trump win. thi latest find fertil an current blaze public argument between the u.s. intellig agenc and the president-elect over russian interfer in the election. “i don’t believ it,” trump state in an interview shown sunday on fox news, discuss the idea that the russian desir to assist him. “i think it’ ridiculous.” trump and hi aid deni not just the cia’ updat review about russian objectives, but the earli consensu reach by all agencies, and reveal in a rare joint public statement by director of nation intellig jame clapper and dh head jeh johnson, that russia wa meddl in the elect in the first place. the signific of the gulf can bare be overstated: numer foreign polici expert and lawmak think russia’ behavior wa an assault on the nation. one ex – cia leader, hillari clinton advoc michael morell, compar russia’ invas into u.s. polit friday to “the polit equival of /.” the truth is, the cia’ latest take is not the unanim perspect of the intellig community. clapper, who overse all u.s. intellig agencies, had suffici confid to exchang the cia’ review to congress in a secret brief last week. but no similar review ha leak from ani of the other intellig agencies. the fbi, for it portion, determin that russia’ main goal wa to stow mayhem and challeng american democracy, a senior law enforc offici explain to nbc news. aid trump provid that objective, the offici stated, but russia didn’t anticip trump to win the election. the cia’ review that the russian prefer trump wa not determin by ani singl piec of new intelligence, offici brief on the matter explain to nbc news. rather, it wa the outcom of more stringent analysi of a grow bodi of circumstanti proof more comprehens than anyth the public ha observed. human sources, commun intercept and other intellig have permit analyst to piec togeth the detail of some of the players, and the step they took to harm clinton’ candidaci while boost trump’s, offici stated. the cia also believ that while russian hacker collect inform on republicans, they did not releas ani of it, the way they did with democrat email leak to wikileaks. the republican nation committe reject it system were hacked, but the email of individu republican were collected-someth nbc news document in october. the fbi is convinc the russian did not find anyth volatil in the republican materi they acquired, the offici stated, despit the fact that it’ not appar whether ani u.s. agenc understand the full extent of what data russian hacker were capabl to steal. the cia also track a campaign of anti-clinton news report amplifi by social media, some of which came from russian state media outlets, offici share with nbc news. the case that the russian campaign wa clearli suppos to elect trump is not someth the u.s. could demonstr in court, offici point out, which in part clarifi whi fbi briefer have been more hesit to embrac that situat in secret brief to congress than have intellig officials. other intellig agenc have not support the cia perspective, but no entiti is acknowledg to oppos it. nevertheless, the question of motive-whi the russian purportedli meddl in the elect – is complet independ from the more basic question of whether the u.s. ha strong proof that the russian govern sponsor the conceal campaign. on that score, everi intellig agenc in the govern confirms: the russian did it. in october, dni clapper and homeland secur secretari jeh johnson releas an extraordinari joint statement that “the u.s. intellig commun is confid that the russian govern direct the recent compromis of e-mail from us person and institutions, includ from us polit organizations.” one sourc acquaint with the intellig state it incorpor profil of some of the suspect with photographs, and could lead to inevit indict of specif russian actors, if the justic depart choos to go after them. the proof on that score basic doesn’t help trump’ recent commentari that “it could be russia. and it could be china. and it could be some guy in hi home in new jersey.” that is whi the two trump propon who lead the congression intellig committees, sen. richard burr of north carolina and rep. devin nune of california, have each suppli statement in recent day convey worri about russian hacking. “the senat select committe on intellig ha been, and remains, concern about russia’ actions,” burr state in report to nbc news friday. nune state friday: “russia’ cyber attack are no surpris to the hous intellig committee, which ha been close monitor russia’ belliger for years.” on monday, the top republican in congress – major leader mitch mcconnel and speaker paul ryan – each releas statement pledg to investig russian meddl in the election. ryan call russia “an aggressor,” and mcconnel made a point of say he ha “the highest confid in the intellig community, and especi the central intellig agency.” on monday, sen. john mccain of arizona renew hi call for a bipartisan hearing, but state he didn’t think russian were attempt to engin a trump victory: “that’ the reason we need a full investigation, but i have seen no evid of that.” it’ actual uncertain whether trump ha been brief on the same fact top republican have observed, becaus he ha had onli a hand of intellig brief sinc the election. trump not onli state he didn’t believ the intellig community’ review – he recommend that the cia wa not to be believ in general, provid a statement friday night observ that “these are the same peopl that said saddam hussein had weapon of mass destruction.” sever intellig offici explain to nbc news they were serious annoy by that statement. there is no histor preced for a president-elect publicli malign the intellig agenc he is about to lead. one big dilemma current is how trump’ pick as cia director, mike pompeo, will bridg the acrimoni gap between hi boss and the agenc he leads. presid barack obama doesn’t plan to make it effortless on trump: he ha request that a dossier be assembl on the data about the russian covert operation. a senior obama administr offici share with nbc news that part of that will be made public prior to januari th. sen. angu king, a main independ who serv on the senat intellig committee, state to nbc news that can not occur soon enough. the way to circumv russian inform campaign is to public them, he stated. he cautioned, however, is that the u.s. is not go to be abl offer the sort of evid mani skeptic are requiring. “if you provid proof, you provid a roadmap to show the russian how we

i don’t know. market are meant to “climb a wall of worry”, with regular corrections. thi seemingli unstopp move upward could be the precursor to a violent correction, possibly? success trader mark minervini recent tweet that the onli time he can rememb the american market be thi exuberant, were just befor the crash, and just befor the dot.com bubbl burst in . however, thi big rise could be justified? mayb us share are re-rat becaus the big corpor tax cut in the us will increas earn considerably? that in turn could trigger an econom boom, of increas invest amp; a virtuou circl of higher growth, greater consum spending, etc. who knows? that’ what happen under presid reagan, after all – he initi stimul the us economi with big tax cuts, which usher in a period of great econom success. these thing are imposs to predict, and nearli all forecast get it so wrong that you would have expect them to pack in forecast as a bad job. yet strangely, peopl (especi the media) still treat their forecast with quit unjustifi reverence. econom is still veri much in it infancy, and ha bare scratch the surface, in term of be abl to accur predict what the economi will do in practice. so i think it’ best to accept that we haven’t got a clue what the futur holds. despit this, i’m increasingli nervou about thi market melt-up, so have open some short posit on the us markets. that’ prove expens so far, but i don’t mind loss on hedges. they’r an insur policy, and insur cost money. as regard the uk markets, i’m see a lot of nervous in small to mid cap at the moment. it feel like the day of everyth go up, day after day, are now over. we’v been spoil by veri buoyant market conditions, for a long time now. there are mani former momentum stars, which have sold off consider in the last few month (e.g. boohoo.com (lon:boo) (i’m long) and iqe (lon:iqe) . investor seem to be ignor mani satisfactory, or even good updates, and bank profit instead. there certainli seem a lack of investor appetit to take small cap to new high at the moment. that’ probabl quit sensibl actually, as lot of small cap are now veri pricey, and the uk economi seem to be in a soft patch, so there seem to be lot of profit warn be issued. mind you, bargain can be found in illiquid markets, when some investor start throw out the babi with the bath water, and/or see their stop loss trigger for no particular underli reason. i favour such market conditions, as from time to time the market throw a bargain in my direction, as peopl sometim act irrat – scare out of good share by errat spike down in price. anyway, let’ have a look at some small cap announc today. by the way, i apologis for ani typo today – am use a small laptop, with a screen that i’m struggl to see properly. (lon:elco) share price: .p (up .% today) no. shares: .m market cap: £.m (at the time of writing, i hold a long posit in thi share) trade statement elecosoft plc (aim: elco), the aim-list construct softwar specialist… clever word make it sound better than it is! thi is an in line update; … is pleas to announc that revenu and profit befor tax trade for the year end decemb are both expect to be significantli higher compar with revenu and profit befor tax for the year end decemb and in line with market expectations. cash gener sound good; elecosoft’ strong convers of oper profit into cash in the year enabl the group to elimin it net borrow posit at june and to also improv it net cash posit further as at decemb . i love it when compani elimin their debt through cash generation. other points; high custom renew rate (a good sign – the product must be good) emphasi on good train amp; support for custom (again, a good thing) success acquisit ha been integrated. favour forex movements. outlook – noth specific, just say “look forward with confidence” my opinion – i pick up a few of these share a while back, on a posit update. gener i’m not keen on softwar companies, as they’r quit prone to profit warn – often be heavili reliant on lumpi licenc sales. thi share look price about right, in my view. it’ good to have a reassur updat today under it belt. stockopedia remain to be convinced, with a “neutral” style, and a middl stockrank of . let’ hope those improve, if financi perform continu to be good. (lon:lpa) share price: ,p (up .% today, at :) no. shares: .m market cap: £.m (at the time of writing, i have a long posit in thi share) final result – for the year end sep lpa group plc (lpa) is a designer, manufactur and supplier of light emit diod (led)-bas light and electro-mechan systems. it announc today; …record result for the year end septemb and a strong start to the new financi year. thi compani put out a positive-sound trade update, which i cover here on nov . as often happens, the surg in share price on the day (respond to a posit updat amp; outlook) continued, with the share price rise about anoth % today. i won’t spend long on thi company, as it’ too small amp; illiquid – i wa onli abl to pick up a few shares. it might be of interest to reader with small portfolios, who don’t have a problem with illiquid positions. key points; revenu up % to £.m pre-except oper profit up % to £.m (except are negligible, so noth to worri about there) basic ep up .% to .p – give a per of . dividend are modest, but grow – up from .p last year, to .p thi year – a yield of .% order intak amp; close order book both up nicely, so the outlook amp; visibl are positive. recent trade – q “significantli ahead” of prior year. balanc sheet – look fine to me, with a sound work capit position. there’ a littl debt, but i don’t see that as a problem. note there is a pension fund, which is in surplu on an account level, but may be in deficit on an actuari basis. it’ not significant, as the cashflow statement show £k p.a. payment by the compani into the fund. capex look high, but the narr mention reloc it factory, which is like to have caus a spike in capex. my opinion – base on a quick review only, i quit like the figur amp; outlook here. so for micro cap investors, happi to accept poor market liquidity, thi might be worth a closer look. it seem soundli financed, perform well, and ha a strong order book. plu it pay modest divis. i think it would be worthwhil to do some more digging, to understand what product it makes. the crucial consider is whether demand is like to continue, or whether the compani is ride on the crest of a wave from one-off orders? overal though, it’ worth a closer look i think. note that the stockopedia data (from thomson reuters) show onli .p ep expect for . so the actual of ep of .p is a long way ahead of that. therefore, we can probabl anticip an improv stockrank, onc the actual number flow through. so i’ll wager that thi middl stockrank could start to improv soon; (lon:boku) share price: p (unchang today) no. shares: .m market cap: £.m trade updat boku (aim: boku), the world’ lead independ direct carrier bill company, is pleas to provid the follow unaudit trade updat for the year end decemb . thi is the company’ first trade updat sinc admiss to aim in novemb . my understand is that thi company’ softwar enabl peopl to buy thing on their mobil phone (apps, games, etc) without the need for a credit card. the cost is instead rout to their mobil phone bill, or prepaid account. thi is use in countri where credit card are not wide used. revenu exceed $m – up % on – and an adjust ebitda posit second half as we know, adjust ebitda can hide a multitud of sin – especi at softwar companies, where larg amount of overhead can be capitalised, thu flatter ebitda. thi is impressive; total process valu (tpv)** of $.bn for wa more than tripl the amount of $ million thank to continu growth across all custom segment – most notabl app store and digit music subscript amp; bundl although if a tripl of total process valu onli result in a % rise in revenues, doesn’t that suggest individu transact are be done a lot more cheaply? look on the stockreport, my first port of call for ani new compani is the histor graphs. these have alreadi scare me off; my opinion – it’ clearli a jam tomorrow situation. the £.m market cap clearli includ some heroic assumpt about futur growth. i don’t tend to buy into thing like that, unless i realli understand the sector amp; the business, which is not the case here. so i think thi one is realli just for punters, and peopl who properli understand the business, and think it’ like to deliv the massiv growth necessari for the current market cap (let alon a higher one). thi remind me of bango (lon:bgo) which look similar, and is also reli on exponenti growth to justifi it extrem high (rel to histor losses) valuation. so these share could be multibaggers, if the growth gain momentum, or they could crash disastrously, if growth disappoints, and heavi loss continu – requir further fundrais in future. high risk, potenti high reward. they’r not for me – whi take the risk? (lon:eye) share price: p (down .% today, at :) no. shares: .m market cap: £.m trade updat eagl eye, the saa technolog compani that allow busi to creat a real-tim connect with their custom here’ our archiv of my previou report on thi company. you can find thi list of articl on ani company, just by put in the ticker, then click on the “discuss” tab, at the top of the stockreport. i don’t like the company’ new descript of what it does, as it doesn’t actual explain what the compani does! it previou descript from a juli announc wa much more clear; saa technolog compani that valid and redeem digit promot in real-tim for the grocery, retail and hospit industri whi chang someth clear, to someth opaque? a veri odd thing to do. clarity, and simplic are alway best. it report today on progress for h of /, be the month to dec . so it ha a june year end. here are the highlights, as present by the company, and yellow highlight from me; there is strong growth in variou kpi there, but revenu is onli up % – not madli exciting. i tend to prefer revenu growth of %+ at growth compani – becaus you don’t need to grow at that rate compounded, for long befor the figur get exciting. cash – the other thing that jump out at me from thi list, is that the compani seem to have burn through most of it cash. look back through previou rnss, the compani rais £m (befor expenses) or £.m after expenses, in jun . so i’m rather surpris it’ onli got £.m left. mayb there wa some debt that wa repaid as part of the previou fundraise? ah yes, i’v spot a £m facil with barclay in the last full year accounts, which look as if it’ current undrawn. i’m not keen on loss-mak compani use bank borrowings. clearli the compani will need to do anoth place fairli soon, as it’ still cash hungry. a lot of develop cost are be capitalised. thi is not necessarili a problem, as the compani seem well-support by investors, with a gener market cap for a loss-mak company. so raising, say, anoth £m would onli result in c.% dilut – unhelpful, but not a disaster. outlook – there’ lot of commentari in today’ updat about custom wins, etc. the conclus is; … confid of deliv it expect for the financi year end june . my opinion – there’ definit someth interest here, in my view. thi compani clearli ha an interesting, innov product, with big name customers. however, for me the financi progress ha to date been somewhat limited. it’ still quit heavili loss-making. look at the broker forecasts, there are big expect for revenu growth, rise to £.m in /, and £.m in /. yet these big increas in revenu would onli just tip it into normalis profit befor tax of just £.m in /. i’m struggl to see how that justifi a £.m market cap now. thi share would therefor onli interest me, if i could be convinc that the compani is set to smash those forecasts, and deliv much higher growth and futur profitability. as thing stand though, i think it look an interest company, with a promising-sound product, but the financi don’t look veri good yet, and the price look a bit toppy. plu it will need to rais more equiti fairli soon, so i’d rather hold fire and re-assess it onc it’ properli funded. i’d say a place of £m+ is realli necessary, rather than do repeat, smaller fundraisings. the danger of that, is that the fundrais window can easili slam shut, in a futur bear market, leav the compani potenti high amp; dry. the stockopedia comput onli award eye a low stockrank of – which is understandable, as earli stage, loss-mak compani nearli alway fail to excit either the stockopedia algorithms, or me! anyway, i wish the compani well, and look forward to review it again when the next set of number come out. as usual, i reserv the right to chang my mind at ani time, if growth acceler and make it a more excit invest proposition. (lon:flo) share price: .p (down .% today) no. shares: .m market cap: £.m trade updat london: tuesday januari : aim list specialist technic fluid power product supplierflowtech fluidpow plc (lse: symbol flo), is pleas to announc the follow unaudit updat on it perform for the year end decemb and to the period up to thi announcement… the updat start with an in line with expect comment, and posit nois about further expansion; “pbt in line with expectations, whilst the group’ heighten profil and enhanc technic skill capabl creat in both the uk and europ ha ensur that opportun for further signific expans have continu to be presented” revenu up % to £.m. scan through the rns, the group seem to have made sever acquisit in , which ha obvious push up revenues. organ growth is good, at +%. net debt ha risen % to £.m. note that there ha also been some dilut thi year, from an equiti fundraising. thi is an excel update, with lot of use information; division gross margin remain broadli in line with the prior year. as a result of a weightier mix toward the gener lower margin pmc operations, a slight reduct in overal margin % is projected, therefore, the board expect underlying* profit befor tax for the year end decemb will be in the rang .m to .m, which is in line with market expectations. i’m impress that the group can give a fairli tight rang of like profit, day after the year end. thi suggest to me that it ha a compet financ department, with good intern controls. six acquisit were made dure the year, which strike me as perhap be a bit too ambitious. there’ a risk that thi might have stretch manag bandwidth a littl thin? a refurbished/redesign share logist centr ha also been completed, with no disrupt to custom service. thi manag team realli have been busy! impress stuff. dividend will rise %, give a yield of .% – not bad. valuat – thi look reason priced, on the cheap side, even when you adjust for net debt; the stockrank is veri high, and it is also classifi as a “super stock”; my opinion – i like it. thi is a stock we’v look at here before, and felt posit about. it strike me as a good qualiti buy amp; build, which appear to be manag veri well. i like the decent oper profit margin – which come from hold a wide rang of nich spare part for variou machinery, and high level of custom service, e.g. rapid deliveri options, which is vital when the clients’ import machin are idle, wait on a spare part from flo. thi share look to me as if it could continu to be a steadi riser, as more acquisit are bolt on. so a thumb up from me. here’ the flo chart (geddit?!!!) – if we’d bought that dip in juli , we’d be % up, plu divis, by now. that’ someth to think about.

too bad lendman still use the hitler card, even when attack israel (and toward jew to a small degree). but the truth is that hitler wa disgust with those two night and had noth to do with their instig or implementation. it wa a stain to hi parti and total against hi direct and desires. what realli happen dure the crystal night now let us look at what realli happen dure that fate night. after ani harm ever done to ani jew in nation socialist germani ha been describ in great detail in mani public and combin with other.stori to give exagger figur which have then becom the so-cal “histor truth.” how strang it is then that despit the passag of more than forti years, no one ha establish the true extent of the damag done to the jew dure the crystal night. all one can learn from histori writer is that “all” synagogu were demolish and that “all” shop window were destroyed. asid from thi vagu description, one is given almost no details. on the basi of the so-cal “histor truth” about the crystal night, the presid of the world jewish congress, nahum goldmann, had the chutzpah in to claim million dollar from german chancellor konrad adenau as repar payment for the damag done dure that novemb night. when adenau ask goldmann for hi justif for thi enorm request, goldmann replied: “you find the justif yourself! what i want is not the justif but the money.” [note ] and he got hi money! goldmann may have interpret the willing of the german chancellor to pay a half billion dollar as proof for the claim that all synagogu had been destroyed. whi els would germani be so foolish as to pay for someth which never happened? all the same, the “histor truth” that “all” german synagogu were destroy is a lie. in there were approxim , synagogu in germany, of which onli about were destroy or damaged. furthermore, jew own approxim , shop and depart store in germani in . of thi number, onli about , had their window broken. these figur show just how much the so-cal “histor truth” differ from what actual happened. the damag and destruct that did actual occur was, of course, a terribl shame, but the exaggerations, especi by german historian who use them to condemn their own people, are also a shame. histori writer tell us that dure the crystal night all the jew were frightened, meekli accept whatev happen to them and watch the destruct of their properti with no resistance. the contrari is true. while go through the file on thi subject, i found mani document which report precis just the opposit of what is claimed. the fact is that in mani case jew and their german neighbor fought togeth against the attackers, push them down staircases. street mob were beaten up and chase away in more than one case. polic and parti offici were gener on the side of the jews. some jewish commun leader went to polic station the next morn and ask the polic to investig the damag done to their synagogues. the result polic report are still avail in the file today. also contrari to what we have been told, most jew were not directli affect by these events. in berlin, for example, all of the teacher and pupil of the city’ largest jewish school, which serv the entir berlin area, appear in their class the next morn without have notic anyth unusu dure the previou night. heinemann stern, the jewish princip of that school, wrote in hi postwar memoir that he notic a burn synagogu on hi way to the school on the morn after the crystal night, but he thought it wa just an accident fire. it wa onli after he arriv at the school that he receiv a telephon call inform him of the destruct of the previou night. he then went on with hi class of the day and onli dure the first recess did he take the troubl to inform the entir student bodi about what had happened. [note ] how can such evid be reconcil with the claim by herman graml, a promin german historian and associ of the munich institut of contemporari history, who wrote: “everi singl jew wa beaten, chased, robbed, insult and humiliated. the sa tore the jew from their beds, mercilessli beat them in their apart and then … chase them almost to death … blood flow everywhere.” [note ] is it conceiv that thousand of jewish children would be have been sent to school by their parent on the morn after that fate night if the attack against jew had been so horrif or extensive? would ani parent have let their children go to school if they had thought there wa even the slightest danger of them be attack by rove gang of sa men? i think the answer is clearli no! deplor thing did inde happen which were bad enough, but the fantasi of modern historian and histori writer such as graml are simpli inexcusable. really, isn’t it silli to compar a day event, immedi shun by the veri one lendman (and everyon else) blames, to a half-centuri long apartheid? someth tell me that there is a group that trump the adolf card and as i have mention before, lendman is a member. h/t stevelendmanblog and ihr (institut for histor review) follow @buelahman buelahuh? did i rub you the wrong way or stroke you just right? let me know below in the comment section or email me at buelahman {at} g m a i l {dot} com if for some reason you actual like thi post, click the “like” button below. if you feel like someon els need to see thi (or you just want to ruin someone’ day), click the share button at the bottom of the post and heap thi upon some undeserv soul. and as sad as thi thought may be, it may be remot possibl that us redneck here at the revolt pleas you enough (or more than likely, you are just a glutton for punishment??), that you feel an overwhelm desir to subscrib via the email subscript and/or rss feed button found on the right hand panel of thi page (may the lord have merci on your soul). comment policy: pleas keep comment relev to the topic. multipl link will automat releg your comment to the spam section, so keep that in mind as you post. st time comment must receiv admin approval, but have free reign after that. all post are opinion meant to foster comment, reporting, teach & studi under the “fair use doctrine” in sec. of u.s. code titl . no statement of fact is made or should be implied. ad appear on thi blog are sole the product of the advertis and do not necessarili reflect the opinion of buehlahman’ revolt or wordpress.com file under: jew world order, real histori tagged: adolf hitler, apartheid, crystal night, eric zuesse, germany, ihr, ingrid weckert, institut for histor review, jews, kristallnacht, nation socialist germany, nsdap, palestinians, stephen lendman, steve lendman, sweeti source: https://buelahman.wordpress.com////playing-the-hitler-card/",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Playing The Hitler Card,B Mans Revolt,,[''],,"Crystal Night, Adolf Hitler, Eric Zuesse, Steve Lendman, Stephen Lendman, Apartheid, Kristallnacht, IHR, Jews, NSDAP, Palestinians, National Socialist Germany, Ingrid Weckert, Germany, Sweetie, Institute For Historical Review",

incapac to maintain endur relationships; reckless disregard for the safeti of others; deceitfulness: repeat lie and con other for profit; incapac to experi guilt; failur to conform to social norm with respect to law behavior. and yet, under the american legal system, corpor have the same legal right as individuals. they give hundr of million of dollar to polit candidates, fund the armi of some , lobbyist in washington and thousand more in state capit to write corporate-friendli legislation, drain taxpay fund and abolish govern oversight. they satur the airwaves, the internet, newsprint and magazin with advertis promot their brand as the friendli face of the corporation. they have high-pric legal teams, million of employees, skill public relat firm and thousand of elect offici to ward off public intrus into their affair or halt messi lawsuits. they hold a near monopoli on all electron and print sourc of information. a few media giants—aol-tim warner, gener electric, viacom, disney and rupert murdoch’ newsgroup—control nearli everyth we read, see and hear. “privat capit tend to becom concentr in [a] few hands, partli becaus of competit among the capitalists, and partli becaus technolog develop and the increas divis of labor encourag the format of larger unit of product at the expens of the smaller ones,” albert einstein wrote in in the monthli review in explain whi he wa a socialist. “the result of these develop is an oligarchi of privat capit the enorm power of which cannot be effect check even by a democrat organ polit society. thi is true sinc the member of legisl bodi are select by polit parties, larg financ or otherwis influenc by privat capitalist who, for all practic purposes, separ the elector from the legislature. the consequ is that the repres of the peopl do not in fact suffici protect the interest of the underprivileg section of the population. moreover, under exist conditions, privat capitalist inevit control, directli or indirectly, the main sourc of inform (press, radio, education). it is thu extrem difficult, and inde in most case quit impossible, for the individu citizen to come to object conclus and to make intellig use of hi polit rights.” labor and left-w activists, especi univers student and well-heel liberals, have fail to unite. thi division, which is often base on social rather than econom differences, ha long stymi concert action against rule elites. it ha fractur the american left and render it impotent. “larg section of the middl class are be gradual proletarianized; but the import point is that they do not, at ani rate not in the first generation, adopt a proletarian outlook,” orwel wrote in dure the last econom depression. “here i am, for instance, with a bourgeoi upbring and a working-class income. which class do i belong to? econom i belong to the work class, but it is almost imposs for me to think of myself as anyth but a member of the bourgeoisie. and suppos i had to take sides, whom should i side with, the upper class which is tri to squeez me out of existence, or the work class whose manner are not my manners? it is probabl that i, personally, in ani import issue, would side with the work class. but what about the ten or hundr of thousand of other who are in approxim the same position? and what about that far larger class, run into million thi time—th office-work and black-coat employe of all kinds—whos tradit are less definit middl class but who would certainli not thank you if you call them proletarians? all of these peopl have the same interest and the same enemi as the work class. all are be rob and bulli by the same system. yet how mani of them realiz it? when the pinch came nearli all of them would side with their oppressor and against those who ought to be their allies. it is quit easi to imagin a work class crush down to the worst depth of poverti and still remain bitterli anti-working-class in sentiment; thi being, of course, a ready-mad fascist party.” coalit of environmental, anti-nuclear, anti-capitalist, sustainable-agricultur and anti-glob forc have coalesc in europ to form and support socialist parties. thi ha yet to happen in the unit states. the left never ralli in signific number behind cynthia mckinney or ralph nader. in pick the lesser of two evils, it threw it lot in with a democrat parti that back our imperi wars, empow the nation secur state and doe the bid of corporations. if barack obama doe not end the flagrant theft of taxpay fund by corpor slug and the disgrac abandon of our work class, especi as foreclosur and unemploy mount, mani in the countri will turn in desper to the far right embodi by group such as christian radicals. the failur by the left to offer a democrat socialist altern will mean there will be, in the eye of mani embitt and struggl working- and middle-class americans, no altern but a pervert christian fascism. the inabl to articul a viabl social ha been our gravest mistake. it will ensure, if thi doe not soon change, a ruthless totalitarian capitalism.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Why I Am a Socialist,,,[''],"Chris Hedges, Truthdig The corporate forces that are looting the Treasury and have plunged us into a depression will not be contained by the two main political parties.

(trendi modern males, aka hipster) that’ what women realli want, a real man and not some confus social engin pussi who think male anatomi is someth he want insid him. i am self employ and support my wide; she stay at home and take care of busi there. i often receiv comment from male friend ask how i found such a love person and get ask “doe she have a sister?” i know how fortun i am to have a love and care wife who look up to her man. i am the head of the hous and head of the relationship. say that to a feminist and you’ll receiv a load of vile abus speech becaus those idiot have no clue about what be a woman is all about. i take care of my wife and love her so much that no other woman, nobody, could even make me slightli tempt to go astray and sleep with her, not ever! imagin my gay life compar thi to life as a gay person. i am not hate gay at all, i just hate what they do and how now they have so mani ‘special rights’. so…i come home to steve, he give me a kiss and ask how my day was. there’ no dinner on the tabl and the home look almost and feel like a museum becaus that feminin touch is miss (even though they act or think they act feminin they can’t ever be the same as a woman.) he’ also a career and money driven man. he like ha met up with someon els who want unsolicit sex today, at least on some phone app to see what’ out there, keep hi ‘options’ open. we are off out later to meet more ‘friends’ who will like bitch about everything, flirt like crazi with each other partner (mayb even take some of them back home for a group session later on.) secretli we feel veri empti becaus we know someth isn’t right, someth is missing.. that could be the natur desir fight in the back of our minds, the need for a woman. then we get to the veri unnatur part of our even and have sex, two male each with the exact same organ and anatomi make love, not abl to creat anyth other than confusion. what is that realli all about? i can’t imagin live with a man (excus for one) who get into bed with me at night, say he love me, and no doubt like most gay sleep around like crazi and pass on whatev diseas from one person to the next. then i can’t have children, he’ not go to feel the way my wife doe about me, never, and i don’t feel that way about him and what a strang futur to think that if it last you’ll grow old and gay (and gray) together. yep, societi with it so-cal ‘leaders’ have realli screw up what god put in place, the marriag arrang of male and female, say that to a lot of peopl and get a load of abuse, especi from feminist who even if they do believ in god will say it’ not a “he” god is a “she”. nice one all the leader of the illuminati for total mess up the mind of many. hope for singl men there is hope but first you have to be a man. you have to stop look at porn and think sex is all there is to a relationship. that’ immedi doom if you want a long last and happi relationship. you have to start look in the right places, not night clubs, date sites, or slutti milf and cougars. you need a good woman with a christian faith, ye that’ right i said christian. believ me, if a woman follow bibl principl she’ll respect and love you, so long as she’ true to her faith and love god. god creat us all and know what’ best so if she love him and is qualities, she’ll love you, so long as you imit the qualiti of god. now you’r like thinking, you need god to get a woman? well no, but trust me, my wife is the onli woman i have ever known who love god. compar to previou partner who said that wa stupid and evolut is the answer for life on earth, she’ by far way ahead of them. a christian woman is humble, love toward all, especi her man and children, doe not care for the thing in the world, doe not want multipl partners. she doe want a long last relationship. show her you are the man and can take the lead and you’ll get back a hundr fold of woman. —- makow comment: mark is describ masculin and feminin which mark is describ masculin and feminin which reflect the fundament activ and passiv principl in nature. t he cabalist black magician are invert thi basic yin yang balanc in natur in order to reengin human to be their servants. the protocol of zion () state: “we will destroy everi collect forc but our own.” thi is how they destroy the nuclear famili . i have downplay sex but intercours is central in male-femal bonding. intercours is the ultim act of surrend for a woman and possess for a man. passive- activ = immut bond. vagin orgasm is essential. by encourag unsatisfi homosexu hook up and anal intercourse, women are be depriv of orgasm and love by the satanist who control discourse. source: http://henrymakow.com///paean-to-my-wife.html",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Paean to My Wife,Henry Makow,,[''],,,

(anoth way of say thi is father-mother-god.) at that time, two thousand year ago, the world wa not prepar for this. we understood this. even back when we were both physic incarnated, we knew that it would be two thousand year befor the world wa ready. that time ha come. thi is the time now. not onli is the world readi to receiv the divin in feminin form, and to receiv my teach of the divin feminine, but the world need this. receiv the divin feminin is veri crucial to your time period right now. there are mani who are awar of this. i am not the first to say thi and thi occas is certainli not the first time of thi be stated. many, mani peopl who are aware, who are conscious, and mani peopl who are tune into higher be are quit cogniz of this, that thi is the time of the divin feminin come through and come forth, and that thi is absolut necessari right now. thi is one of the reason whi i have been come through to mercedes, as well as to other people. part of my work is to be a leader in the transform that human are in the process of undergoing. thi is a transform from have the divin masculin as the predomin messag you receiv and incarn for a veri long time. that messag ha predomin both in term of your spiritu and also in term of your more mundan world and aspect of that world—your politics, culture, education, and person development. all of these have been quit domin by the masculine, what you could call the divin masculine. now it is time for the divin feminin to come forth, to be incarnated, to be understood, and for all of you—men and women alike—to becom strong in the feminine, so that you can come into balanc between the masculin and the feminine. first and foremost, thi must happen within yourselves. you all have your own inner feminin and masculine, which is a reflect or manifest of the divin feminin and divin masculine. for all of you, thi is where the work originates, within yourselves. for mani of you, thi will requir strengthen the feminine, becaus thi ha not been support and develop for a very, veri long time. even those of you who feel great love of the feminin and the divin feminine, who feel veri posit orient toward the feminine, even you often have work within yourselv to do to strengthen your inner feminine. thi is veri practic work. there are veri practic arena that need to be develop for thi to becom strong, becaus it ha been withheld from you, in so mani ways, for so veri long. as i talk about in the messag that are record in the book mari magdalen beckons, there are three primari arena where the feminin need to be strong. it is within these three arena that mani peopl need to examin themselv and see what work they may have to do to complet the strengthen of the feminin within. thi is so import for peopl to do at thi time. first and foremost, thi is work for you to do with yourself, for your own strengthen and balancing. secondly, thi work need to be done for your sacr relationship you will be engag in your life, that these can come into balance. the third veri import reason is that you are not onli do thi work for yourself. you do thi as servic to humanity, for your whole world. as you transform, as you strengthen and develop and grow yourself, you are affect what is access for people, what is avail to people, and what is becom strong for your whole world. ani time you do growth and transform work for yourself, it affect everyone. that is very, veri import at thi time. you are all at a veri critic juncture, where there is great opportun open up for your world, and for human beings, in particular, to transit into a higher level of consciousness. thi will be reflect in a higher dimens of realiti come in and be the realm that you all inhabit, that you know, that you live in and are manifest in. thi is the great opportun you have at thi time. those of you who are on your spiritu path, who are light-workers, veri like those of you who are listen to me at thi time, mani of you are quit awar of this. i, and so mani be of the higher realms, thank you for all that you are do to support thi amaz transform that is underway in your world. thi is not onli affect the earth. thi transform is so vast and involv so mani place in your universe, all of which you are affect through the spiritu work you are doing. it is most important. we thank all of you for this. i am awar that i have wander away a bit from where i started, which wa explain about the divin feminin and the arena through which thi manifest within each of you. now i wish to return to that. what i want to explain is that there are these three arena that are the foundat of the divin feminin within each one of you: the relationship with your physic body, the relationship with your sexuality, and the relationship with your emotions. for each of you, these are the place that i strongli urg you to examin and see what may need strengthen within yourself. thi is what i talk about in great depth in the messag i gave in the book mari magdalen beckons, along with my guidanc and instruct as to what each of you can do to strengthen these areas. as i said at that time, of these three, the area that is most critic for the most peopl is the way that you respond to pain. the area of emotions, for mani people, is quit confusing. your emot are truli a gift from the divin that is rather uniqu to human be in your realm. yet mani of you do not yet fulli understand how to receiv thi gift that ha been given to you in the emot realm and how to work with emotions, particularli your pain emotions. thi is the part that is most challeng for mani of you. you did not receiv help and support and guidanc in understand the pathway of how to respond to pain emotions, how to receiv the gift from god that’ be given to you through these emotions, and how to make use of emot to support your spiritu journey, to support your unit with god. becaus you did not receiv that instruct and that guidance, and becaus you do not fulli understand it, i especi focus on that in my earlier messag that are record in mari magdalen beckons. i gave detail instruct about how you can respond differ to your pain emot in a way that will be most support of you, most support of your spiritu connection, and most support of your forward movement in your spiritu evolution. i did thi because, from my vantag point, thi is the area that is hold most peopl back from their spiritu growth in general, and specif from the incarn of the divin feminine. thi is whi i said earlier that while mani of you are so posit orient to the divin feminin and the feminin in all her form (which is a most wonder thing), even so, for mani of you there may still be work to do in these three arenas, and especi in the emot arena in term of how you respond to pain. i urg you to make use of the instruct i have given and to learn these pathway of incarn the divin feminine, which will support you and help to transform you, and in that process, transform your world. *********************************** copyright merced kirkel, http://www.mercedeskirkel.com, all right reserved. pleas copi and share thi articl as long as it is share in it entirety, includ thi

or have you taken the medic in way that it wasn’t prescribed. questioner: both. i’v taken it in way that weren’t prescrib and i’m work with a therapist to get off of it. it’ onli in the past two month that i’v been abl to acknowledg thi and been honest about it. so i’d like ani guidanc about get off of it, but also help with thi shame i feel around it. there’ anoth shame, too, that start when i wa realli young. thi wa the first shame, which i’m just start to realize. when i wa realli young, like still in diapers, i masturbated. grow up in a cathol household, i knew that it wa so shameful. and i still feel so much shame around that now. i wa so young; i don’t know whi i did it. mari magdalene: thank you for speak this. when one ha shame, even speak it is difficult becaus there is so much fear about be ostracized, be abandon if you show peopl the part of yourself that you feel shame for. so speak about it is the begin of healing. it show that, first, you’v becom awar and honest with yourself that thi is what’ go on, that you have these area that you have shame about. then you begin to find peopl who you can trust, who it’ safe to share thi with and open up thi part of yourself to them. that, in and of itself, is a great step of healing. you need to have discern in speak to other about this. it is import to onli open yourself up with peopl who you discern that are safe. there are peopl who it may not be safe to open up to, peopl who may not understand or hold these event in the same way you do. it is not necessari or even wise for you to open up to those people. you can be in choic about who the peopl are who are safe for you to open up to, the peopl who will be support for you to open up to, who actual will help you in the way that you are want help. so be veri awar of your choic and start to empow yourself to be in choic rather than be at the effect of random respons from random individuals. how doe that part feel to you? questioner: that feel good. that give me a lot of secur and guidance. mari magdalene: yes. thi is the begin of reclaim your own person power. when there’ shame, you have given away a part of your power to someon or some entiti that you probabl trusted. now, at the stage of life you’r current in, you may realiz that they weren’t entir trustabl or they weren’t entir for your highest good. they gave you messag that what you were do wa bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or that somehow you, yourself, were bad, wrong, sinful, evil, or deficient, not right, not good enough becaus you were engag certain behaviors. thi is a veri sad state of affairs. it is a veri third-dimension issu becaus in the third-dimension conscious there is a veri strong belief in these dualiti of good-bad, right-wrong, evil-godly, those kind of things. at the higher dimensions, we see thing veri differently. we see those kind of dualiti as quit destructive, quit harm to people’ spiritu growth and their spiritu path. part of the spiritu process at the third dimens is realiz that mani peopl have been program with thi kind of think that certain thing are good and certain thing are bad; certain thing are godli and certain thing are ungodly; that kind of thing. those belief are not a given. it is a choic to hold such beliefs. i would like to suggest a veri differ possibility, which from my point of view is part of the transcend of the third dimens and move into a higher-dimension consciousness. that possibl is to see that there is no such thing as good-bad. there is no such thing as right-wrong. all there are is experi that are either support you or not support you in your divin growth and unfoldment. when you were veri young and you were touch yourself or experienc your sexual energi through form of touch and self-pleasur in whatev way you did, thi certainli wa not bad or wrong in ani way at all, from my point of view. i see it as a complet natur thing to do becaus you were becom awar of your physic bodi and your energy—includ your sexual energy, which is connect to your physic body. you were explor that. to me that is as healthi as learn how to walk, where you’r explor your physic bodi and it possibl for mobility. no one said you were bad or wrong or evil for explor movement and walking. i certainli don’t see you as ani more bad, wrong, or evil for learn about and explor your sexual energi and your physic sexuality. i see it as most unfortun that institutions, such as the cathol church, have promot thi belief that you are bad, wrong, sinful, or whatev els for do what i consid to be not onli a veri natur thing but a healthi thing. sexual is part of who we are. it’ no more evil than your appetit for food. peopl don’t call be hungri and have a meal evil. hunger is simpli an energi you have in your bodi that’ connect to physic system that are natur to your body. the same is true of sexuality. however, sexual ha the potenti for connect you with god in a veri profound way, a way that for most peopl is much more profound than most of your other bodili functions. in fact, thi is whi religi institut have tri to convinc peopl that sexual is bad, wrong, or whatever. if you did not have that belief, if you believ or understood that your sexual is natural, healthy, important, and a vital part of your life of connect to god, you would be a natur empow person—empow to transcend the limit of the third dimens and third-dimension thinking. those institut have not want peopl to becom empow in that way, becaus they benefit from people’ separ from their own power, people’ obedi to them and place them in a posit of power. thi is all part of the third-dimension legacy. it’ all part of what be are learn about and learn to transcend and grow beyond in their experi in come to earth. not onli is it part of your spiritu path to explor your sexuality, but it is part of your spiritu path to go beyond the limit of the think that say your sexual is shame or sin in ani way, to go beyond be limit by thi kind of belief structure. so from my point of view, in mani way you are right on course. you’r have your experi of have been limit by have taken on these belief systems, which wa probabl a veri natural, understand thing to do becaus you encount them as a child. veri likely, the one who you were trust to discern for you which belief were support for you to take on believ this. so you took it on becaus they believ it. but now you are an adult. you are grow and matur spiritually. thi is your time to becom awar and consciou of what you choos to believe, what you choos to follow, what idea you choos to empow as thing that seem true, in the sens that they are consist with your own experi and your own guidance. i am guess from what you’v said that you no longer ascrib to the belief that sexual or even masturb is inher wrong or bad or sinful, and yet you are struggl with earlier programming. is that right? questioner: correct. mari magdalene: even thi kind of convers can be immens help in understand that that is just one option amongst many, mani options. from my point of view, you were probabl a sensit child. your awar of energi wa probabl veri high. so you were natur awar of your sexual energi at a young age, possibl younger than mani other people. and you were empow yourself to explor this. these are all veri wonder things, from my point of view. there is certainli no harm, that i am awar of, that can come to a child from explor their sexuality, masturbating, and have orgasms. but becaus of their programming, other individuals—veri like includ your famili members—may have been uncomfort with this. it may have been in conflict with their beliefs, or the level of shame that they carried, or their comfort around sexual altogether, becaus of the program they receiv and ascrib to. in fact, the problem wa probabl much more on the part of those who told you that you were wrong. mayb they didn’t even tell you that. mayb they just were experienc that within themselves. and becaus you are a veri sensit being, you pick up on their discomfort, their conflict, and their beliefs. and you took that on. doe that seem accurate? questioner: that’ exactli how it seems. mari magdalene: so the first part is to realiz that these were realli their issues, their difficulty, their challeng that you took on, not your own. you were simpli be your own natural, sensit self. what’ import is to realiz that the decis of your to take on their issu as your own issu wa your choice. of cours you were veri young and it is natur to do thing like that when you are young. but nevertheless it wa a choice. now you have the choic to no longer continu to take on those belief or those conflict that other are carrying. can you sens thi in yourself? questioner: yes, absolutely. mari magdalene: again, it doe not mean that you need to go tell everyon you meet that you feel differ or that you have a differ point of view. that may not be supportive. you are in choic about who you share thi with. but you can certainli do thi for yourself in relationship to these arenas. you can do thi rel to sexuality. and you can also do thi rel to your use of the medicin that you were taking. i have been shown veri strongli that whenev a be make a choice, there are alway veri wonderful, or you could say beautiful, reason for that choice. those reason are what i have call your “inner divin qualities.” when you made the choic to first take the medicine, and then later to take it more than wa be prescribed, you had veri import reason whi you made that choice. it doesn’t mean that the outcom of that choice—th outcom of the behavior that you chose to engage—ar one that you are pleas about. it could be that you look at the outcom of those behavior and you regret that choice. you regret that you chose to act upon your motiv in that particular way. but regret and shame are veri differ things. regret is part of the human experience. human make choices. in retrospect, some of the choic you are happi about and some of the choic you are not happi about. both serv your growth. so it is fine to make choic that you are not happi about. that is part of the growth process. when you realiz you’v made choic you’r not happi about, most human experi regret. but if you have been given the program that whenev you feel regret it mean you’r a bad person, then veri like that regret will turn into shame. shame is say “there’ someth defect about me becaus i made thi choice, or i took thi action.” that is base on a combin of regret and judgment. you’r make judgment about yourself, such as: “i should have known better.” “i should have been stronger.” “i shouldn’t have been vulner to thi kind of artifici support.” are you make those kind of judgment about yourself? questioner: yes. mari magdalene: are there other judgment that you’r making, too? questioner: it tend to be the same things: “i shouldn’t have done that.” “i should be stronger.” “i shouldn’t be so emotional.” … mari magdalene: “i should know better.” “i should be more stable.” “i should be more like other peopl who don’t have these problems.” those kind of things? questioner: absolutely. mari magdalene: yes. “there’ someth the matter with me that i can’t do it right.” questioner: exactly. mari magdalene: when you set all those judgment aside, are you abl to feel someth differ in term of an emotion, other than shame, rel to your take thi medicine? questioner: yes. mari magdalene: what is it that come up? questioner: more compassion. mari magdalene: and perhap regret or sad for the situat that you’r in? questioner: yes, sad and regret. but especi when you were talk about the inner divin qualities, then i feel compassion. mari magdalene: yes. there are two things. you have sad that engag with these medicin hasn’t support you in the way that you were hoping. is that true? questioner: correct. mari magdalene: and it ha had some neg ramifications. is that right? questioner: yes. mari magdalene: yes. what i would like to look at are the inner divin qualiti that you were hope to fulfil by take thi medicine, and even take more than wa prescribed. what were you hope to accomplish by that, conscious or unconsciously? questioner: power over myself—b powerful. also be productive, get stuff done. be abl to connect with people. i think i also use the medicin to mask some depression, as well. so i want to be joy and happi to connect with people, and give that joy and happi to people. mari magdalene: beautiful! thi is the import thing that will help you the most with shame. it is to realiz there were veri valid, important, and even beauti reason whi you were make these choices. you want to have power over yourself. you want to be product and functional. you want to connect with others. you want joy in your life. these are wonderful, import thing that everyon need in their life. you were choos thi modal of tri to accomplish these things. perhap it didn’t work the way that you were hoping. but that doesn’t mean that you are a bad person. it simpli mean you made a choic that didn’t work out the way that you were hoping. now what you can do is take step to make a differ choice. take step to get off of the substance, if that’ what you choos to do, or whatev seem like the wisest choic now to accomplish these same things. becaus it’ still import that you have all of these things: that you feel empowered, that you are function and productive, that you connect with others, and that you have joy in your life. you still need all of those things. you can simpli shift from thi self-judg and paralyz posit of “i’m bad,” to “i tri something. it didn’t work the way i had hoped. now i’m go to look at what els i can do to fulfil these import inner divin qualities.” how doe that land with you? questioner: that’ veri help and feel veri healing. mari magdalene: wonderful. hope you are find peopl who can support you in find practic step you can take to fulfil these inner divin qualities, which will support you in better way than the way you were tri through the medicine. i highli recommend that you also chang your languaging. rather than saying, “i have a substance-abus problem,”—becaus you’r label yourself as one who’ involv in abuse—say, “i have a problem with my use of thi medication. it’ not support me. i want to chang that.” simpli state what is without ani judgment. can you feel the difference? questioner: absolutely. yes. (laughing) thank you, that feel so much better. mari magdalene: (laughing) wonderful. questioner: i have anoth question about depression. i have a big fear of depression. i anticip have depress as a result of the chemic chang i’m go to have in my bodi through go off thi medication. i think i start to use the medic to mask some depression. it’ realli the fatigu and lack of motiv that i don’t like. mari magdalene: yes. so that is wonder becaus now you’r get to the root of the issu that motiv you origin to use the medication. and again, you can look at other options. it may be that you need medic to help you with depression, but you can look at use medic as one option. you can look at which medic would be most helpful, if you choos to engag medication. find someon who can help you with your full spectrum of concerns. you may want to work with someon more natur oriented, who is open to the use of medic as one option, and who can help you sort through all the variou possibilities, as well as your concerns. then they can help you to come up with a holist program that will be tailor to you and will hope help you the best. they can also help you to monitor the program and how it’ work for you. then, if you start with a medic and find out it’ not work the way you hoped, or it ha consequ you didn’t realiz beforehand, you can make choic about what step to take. you can also start to look at natur option for handl depression. there may be thing in your diet that could chang the actual biochemistri in your body. there could be thing like exercise. there could be certain social engag or a support group of some sort or other, work with a therapist or a coach. there may be all kind of things. so i suggest that you get a support person who you like where they’r come from, who you trust, and who you feel ha the understand of the full picture, so they can help you to access all the differ kind of resourc you may need. questioner: thank you. that’ veri helpful. mari magdalene: wonderful. © merced kirkel, http://www.mercedeskirkel.com, all right reserved. permiss is given to share thi messag as long as the messag is post in it entirety, noth ha been chang or alter in ani way, and merced kirkel’ credit of authorship, thi copyright notice, and merced kirkel’ websit (http://www.mercedeskirkel.com) are included. if you would like to receiv more messag like this, merced kirkel is a # best-sel and multi-award-win author, bring forth messag and instruct from mari magdalen and other be of light. her first book, mari magdalen beckons: join the river of love is avail at www.marymagdalenebeckons.com. mercedes’ latest book, sublim union: a woman’ sexual odyssey guid by mari magdalene, is avail at www.sublime-union.com. all messag and practic are univers and are not affili with ani religion. to receiv ongo messag from mari magdalen and other be of light through mercedes, go to www.mercedeskirkel.com and request to be ad to the mail list. merced offer workshop and privat session in the san francisco bay area, ca, includ guidanc from mari magdalen and other be of light, heart-sourc life-and-relationship coaching, light-fil intimacy™ instruction, and spiritu mentoring. she is avail in-person or long distanc (bi phone and skype), or to travel to your location. for more information, go to www.mercedeskirkel.com. note from mercedes: if you feel serv by mari magdalene’ messag and would like to make a donat to support the post of these messages, i would greatli appreci it. just click on the button below. thank so much! receiv the next book of messag from mari magdalene: sublim union: a woman’ sexual odyssey guid by mari magdalen a sacr sexual manual and erot memoir copyright merced kirkel, http://www.mercedeskirkel.com, all right reserved. pleas copi and share thi articl as long as it is share in it entirety, includ thi copyright notice, and the inform is not altered, excerpted, or ad to; credit of authorship and my websit address (www.mercedeskirkel.com) is included; and no money is exchanged. for ani other uses, pleas contact merced kirkel at www.mercedeskirkel.com to obtain permission. thank you. source: http://mercedeskirkel.com/mary-magdalene-healing-shame-around-addictions-and-sexuality/",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,MARY MAGDALENE: Healing Shame Around Addictions and Sexuality,Mercedes Kirkel,,[''],,,

headline: bitcoin & blockchain search exceed trump! blockchain stock are next! i am a mother of four in my mid \’ and i have been told that i have some psychic abilities, mainli psychometry, paranormal, and late remot viewing. thing come to me in the form of pictur in my mind, feel and impressions, and sometim sounds. i typic get them when ask to focu on specif object or events. i clear my mind, think of the question or object and thi blog is an exampl of what i get. thi blog is a way for me to organ all my thoughts. : pm – hmm….ok, i am visual research in a scientif lab, and they are tri to like studi the whole fertil process and tri to determin what gene do what, and i am see like thi board on the wall. and it will say blue eye, and like have notat besid it, it is not legibl to me and written in scientif lingo, and then it will say like brown eyes, blond hair, like all these differ attribut like a person could have. it is a huge list. and they are tri to scientif figur out how to creat human with certain physic characterist and intelligence. then the next thing that i see is a coupl and they are in a wait room in a doctor office, and it is like the guy is hold the woman’ hand and she look like she ha been crying. and my impress is that they are want a child, they cannot get pregnant, and they are at that desper phase. the i see a dr. take them back and start to explain differ fertil options, and then the doctor are hand the coupl a menu, like they can custom order their baby. and it feel to me that dr.’ are prey upon emot of peopl who cannot have kids, collect huge amount of money for fertil procedures, to fund the bigger pictur of studi and learn how to custom babies. i feel like these realiti show are out there to one let peopl know that all these procedur exist, but secondly, to desensit you to everyth that they are doing. and it is like i am hear some futurist slogan of “whi adopt, just custom your baby” or someth like that. that is all i initi get. q-whi do feel mani coupl are infertile? a-i see a person standing…and they have what look like these waves, like bombard their body, even go through their body. and it feel like we are so bombard with electron or magnet wave that it pollut your body. and that is whi i feel like when you are younger it is usual easier to get pregnant than when you are older, and that is in part due to the toxin buildup in your bodi from these wave that are constantli bombard it. q-do you feel peopl today actual select their true genet mates, base off nature, pheromon and a mate that is a compliment to their own dna? vs. less compat mate base on other factors. a-i see that as individu for the person, so some peopl yes, and some peopl no. but the thing that i do see is that peopl with long last relationship that are creat from their own free choice, are gener more compatible. the less compat peopl i feel have veri short live relationships. q-do you see all babi be test tube babi in the future, and if so how long from now. a-for the first part, i do not see all babi be test tube babies, i feel like the test tube babi are more for the wealthy, or peopl who are abl to come up with the fund for it. i feel like it is go to be in the late ′s or earli ′s, when it is like launch and societi start to accept it. i see there be like a huge controversi thing lead up to it and it will take a while for thi to be acceptable, and part of the media now is just to, kind of in small doses, get peopl familiar with altern ideas. and i keep feel there is a huge amount of money to be made in thi industry. q-i it motiv by money more than by helping. a-yes, becaus i just keep feel that money part of it. q-when doe concept start? a-i keep see it as when the first cell divides. q-time frame from when sperm meet egg. a-i keep see , it might be minute, but i am lean toward hour. q-defin conception, when soul, spirit, life force, whatev enter the cell. what is it? a-i see it as a golden light, shoot into the woman’ stomach, and as a cell divides, it start to glow, and i feel like it is combin of spirit, with univers knowledge..,that nugget…ent the cell right in that moment when it divides. q-so with in vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combin outsid the body, doe concept still happen without the woman? a-yes, but it is weird, i am get a pictur of a person, and they look like they are catatonic, so i feel like until it is implant in the woman, like the warmth and person doe not penetr the embryo. it is like someth is not right with the fertil egg until it is in the woman. q-have children been born, without the use of a mother or surrogate? a-i am get no, becaus you still need the placenta to provid nourish to the baby, and there is no way to replic that. q-whi can human embryo not be implant into anim host mothers? a-it ha someth to do with their blood, there is some kind of blood exchang or someth with the blood that make it not possible. q-like whi can a primate, not carri a human embryo? is that combin possible? a-i do not know, i just keep get someth about the blood. q-do we pick our own parent when we incarnate? a-hmm.. q-i do not feel like we pick our own parents, but we pick like the situation, or circumst we live in…to complet our life lesson and to spiritu evolve. i feel like on the other side of life we all have the same goal, to evolv to the next dimension, but it is unclear to us now in our earthli bodies. but i think that when we die, all of that becom veri clear. a-i abort wrong? q-well there is two side to it, one that is the individu choic and they have to live with the decis that they made, but then the second side of it is in some way i feel it might be fate, that mayb it wa soul that jump in too soon, and it just wa not readi to incarn yet. in some way it is even a life lesson for the person that is experienc the abort becaus i see a person walk around and it is almost like they are hunch backed, with a big weight on their shoulder and they have to carri that emot weight of that decis forever. and i feel like mayb that is one of their life lesson dure their existence. q-i the us or other countri current produc “menu” babies?

is there a way to stop them? a. the first thing i hear in my head is that each storm will be more grandios that the last. then i see a chess board…a if each side is take turn back and forth…it look like they are play chicken with one anoth to see who do what. and by say they’r i am refer to the unit states….i want to say japan, but i feel like they are somehow interconnect with china…russia is start to becom a player but they are kind of behind with technology. those are the main counti i see involved. with regard to the weather in , i see the northeastern part of the unit state be a target with a focu on ny. then i hear a phrase “the surround state are just collater damage”. i see a bunch of swirl on a map that are white indic blizzard type storms, just one after another, again with a focu on ny. i am get the reason that there is such an imbal in the weather is becaus as we receiv an attack that caus inclim weather, we tri to counteract it with these unseason warm weather conditions. and even though the result may be storm or tornadoes, it felt that it is less sever than the inclim weather, and the u.s. is not good at regul how sever it be. it seem to be full blast in the cold direct or full blast in the hot direction. i see that in the earli summer around the end of may, there is go to be realli bad storm on the southeast coast, clear from florida up to south carolina, it look like a bad hurrican and it blow just right up the whole coast. in the summer i see a big line of fire….and it look to be on the western side of illinoi and it span the whole length of the state. my mind want to tell me forest fire, but without a map i can’t be sure. in the washington state area i keep see icefall, and it look like big long icicles, and it look like a sever ice storm in store for that area. when i ask myself if there is a way to “stop them” it look as if it would be veri difficult, the pictur in my mind is a group of peopl in the top of a tower, and there is a mob of peopl beneath them on the ground, and there is no way to reach the peopl in the tower (weather manipulators), it is as if they are untouchable. q. whi is ny the focus? a. ok i am get a lot of reason come in….on that it is an older citi and it is vulnerable, becaus of it’ position, it is a financi heartbeat of the country, and i see a map of the us and ny is pulsat like a heart. it is realli popul dense, so a hardship realli affect a lot of people. q. pleas tell us about how the fukushima problem will impact the world. hope enough peopl will focu on heal fukushima that it will avoid ani major impact on the earth. a. the first thing i see is litter and the trash wash up on the beaches…i also see a lot of seafoam and at first it seem cool, but as peopl start to put their hand or feet into it, it ha thi coat about it that feel like soap scum. the other imag i have too is big fish boat that are in the pacific, are get a lot of garbag in their fish nets. i am see an imag of someon on a boat and they spot what look like a big school of jellyfish, and when the get close enough to examin it, it is like a ton of these plastic bags. it is like the garbag float in “schools”. i get that peopl becom veri concern with consum the fish out of that part of the pacif ocean, to the point where a lot of peopl in the u.s. won’t even buy it. i also see orang dust in the air over the west coast, and i see these vineyard in california be concern with the dust on their grapes. it is like it is kill the grapes. it is like dust that come over in cloud from the pacific, move in an eastern direction. i see fukushima mainli affect the countri that are to the east. i mean the water and the air is all taint but it is much more dilut to the countri to the west of fukushima, so the eastern countri will have the higher effect of radiat and pollution. q. hi, just wonder on news on your red comet? is the red comet ison? or is it yet to come? storm here have been the worst in yrs. a. ok when i ask for the name, i am not given a name but i am given a picture. what i see is the earth, thi comet (the “red comet’) and the sun. be in perfect align right now. and the reason that thi comet is hard to see is becaus it is directli in front of the sun and the bright of the sun blind us from it. then i am get a phrase say “i haven’t given you a name but i have given you everyth you need to know”. q. regard the latest storm to hit the philippines; wa thi a man made storm and what wa it purpose? i read that the water fuel car wa about to be market there, could that be one of the reason for the weather attack? a. i see we were tri to get the phillippin to join us, by get member of their govern to form an alli group, and they resisted. i see thi american guy in a suit and he is tri to put hi arm around thi philippin guy’ shoulder, the philippin guy total resisted, and the american guy had an arrog about him and wa complet offended. then i see two kid pick at each other, one poke the other and say “how do you like that?”, and then the other pick back and say “what about that.” and it doe look to me that we retali becaus they did not want to be in busi with us (us), but i also get thi feel of regret or remors like it went way too far. there is like some shame and embarrass associ with it too. when i ask if it wa associ to the car, i just see a big field full of oil pump working, so in my mind the answer is that it wa relat to the car. : pm link to audio source: http://psychicfocus.blogspot.com///-earth-changes-weather-fukushima.html",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,2014 – Earth Changes – Weather – Fukushima,Psychic Focus,,[''],,,

(i wa a littl saddened. i wasn’t as interest in how anakin fell as how han and leia got married.) then the prequel were. . well. . .awful. so, the news that in our middl age, the last three would be made wa met with excit mix with a lot of anxiety. would these be awful, too? would they be all ewok and jar jar? would the act be so bad as to make you laugh in inappropri parts? so, with some trepidation, a gener of viewer bought ticket ahead of time to see episod vii. and it wa good. mayb great, mayb amazing, but definit all wa good. at the end there wa clap and rejoicing, for the stori but also for the sens that the movi maker (disney now, not georg lucas) heard the fans. understood what wa so genre-defin and game-chang about episod iii. gave the fan the story, without muppet and bad actors. if the origin movi reson with the audience’ prior about good and evil, the latest instal reson with the audience’ need to be understood and heard. georg luca ha critic the “retro” episod vii for pander to the fans. whatever. i love it. i walk out and want to walk right back in again. if you’v seen the movie, then you can track episod vii and episod iii and have alreadi realiz they are the same (awesome) movie. there is a bad guy, who use to be a good guy (kylo ren), and a bad guy mentor (suprem leader snoke), who are tri to take over the galaxi under the name the first order. there is a resist leader who ha secret inform (poe) who give it to a droid (bb-) to deliv it to the resistance. there are two young peopl who bump into bb-′ mission (rey and finn) and each have their own reason for follow or want to leave. both rey and finn have part of luke and han solo. rey is a scaveng and a tinker and a pilot (like han), but she obvious ha a higher call to the forc (like luke). finn is move by love (like luke), but also ha self-preserv tendenc (like han). but they are interest in their own right. finn is fn-, a stormtrooper. these icon troop that have been nameless and faceless to star war fan now have a backstory. finn wa taken from hi famili by the first order and program to fight. (hi program seem to not have taken at all!) after hi first battle, finn decid to escap but need a pilot to help him. luckili for him, poe is be held prison and is the best pilot in the resistance. together, they escape, head toward jakku, to find bb- and take the secret inform back to the resistance. after their ship is disabled, finn wake up on jakku, where he meet up with rey, who ha befriend bb-. after stormtroop come calling, the three take off in the millennium falcon (!!) to get the inform to the resistance. guess what the inform is? a map to where luke skywalk ha been live in self-impos exile!! so, the stori is set and the parallel to the origin lead one to predict where the plot is go to go. charact are relat to one another, someon die in a way that inspir the newest jedi, etc. along the way we meet back up with han and chewbacca, and even gener (nee princess) leia. there are many, mani moment of homag to the original, and i ate them up with the rest of the audience. there are lot of thing to criticize, of course. the galaxy, which ha as mani non-humanoid be as humanoid beings, seem to be about % femal and .% nonwhite. droid may be more slave than robot. (we rewatch the origin three, and even in those movies, droid inconsist feel pain, fear tortur or destruction, and have feelings.) as mani peopl have point out, the best part of the movi are unoriginal. but i will watch it again and again. rey is a much more interest femal charact than princess leia, and a less whini jedi than luke. (don’t get me start about hayden christensen’ anakin. anakin is such a bad jedi, he make finn look like a great stormtrooper.) finn seem also more three-dimension than han. i’m veri interest to see where the plot is going. where is the plot going? one of the star war trailer ha a voice-ov by luke (mark hamill), say “the forc is strong in my family. my father ha it. i have it. my sister ha it. and you have it.” thi is a riff on the same speech luke give leia in episod vi, but with the last sentenc added. thi speech is never given in episod vii (in fact luke doesn’t speak in thi episode). so, we assum that he will eventu give the speech to rey, but how doe rey have the force? is she relat to luke? will the movi ever mention midichlorian again (no!). to be continued. . . .",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Family Film Blogging (Special Edition): Star Wars: The Force Awakens,The Conglomerate,,[''],,,

could american democraci be replac with totalitarian rule? there' enough resembl that yale historian timothi snyder, who studi fascist and communist regim chang and totalitarian rule, ha written a book warn about the threat and offer lesson for resist and survival. the author of on tyranny: twenti lesson from the twentieth centuri talk to alternet' steven rosenfeld. steven rosenfeld: three week ago, you said that the countri ha perhap a year 'to defend american democracy.' you said what happen in the next few week is crucial. are you more concern than ever that our polit cultur and institut are evolv toward fascism, resembl key aspect of the earli th-centuri european regim you’v studied? timothi snyder: let me answer you in three parts. the first thing is that the lesson that i wrote, i wrote on novemb th. the book, on tyranny, wa done by christmas. which mean if peopl read it now, and peopl are read it, and it' describ the world they are in, that mean i’v success made predict base on history. we’r go to talk about what is go to come, but i want to point out that timeline—it wa basic complet blind. but the book doe describ what is go on now. the year figur is there becaus we have to recogn that thing move fast. nazi germani took about a year. hungari took about two and a half years. poland got rid of the top-level judiciari within a year. it’ a rough histor guess, but the point is becaus there is an outsid limit, you therefor have to act now. you have to get start early. it’ just veri practic advice. it’ the meta-advic of the past: that thing slip out of reach for you, psycholog veri quickly, and then legal almost as quickly. it’ hard for peopl to act when they feel other peopl won’t act. it’ hard for peopl to act when they feel like they have to break the law to do so. so it is import to get out in front befor peopl face those psycholog and legal barriers. am i more worri now? i realiz that wa your question. no, i’m exactli as worri as i wa before, in november. i think that the peopl who inhabit the white hous inhabit a differ ideolog world in which they would like for the unit state not to be the constitut system that it now is. i wa concern about that in november. i’m concern about it now. noth that ha happen sinc ha chang the way i see things. sr: let’ talk about how thi evolut take place. you’v written about how 'post-truth is pre-fascism.' you talk about leader ignor facts, law and history. how far along thi progress are we? i’m wonder where you might see thing go next. ts: that’ tough becaus what histori doe is give you a whole bunch of case where democrat republ becom authoritarian regimes; sometim fascist regimes, sometim communist regimes. it doesn’t give you one storyline: a, b, c, d. it give you a bunch of cluster of a, and a bunch of cluster of c. but factual is realli import and more import than peopl realize, becaus it’ the substructur of regim change. we think about democracy, and that’ the word that american love to use, democracy, and that’ how we character our system. but if democraci just mean go to vote, it’ pretti meaningless. russia ha democraci in that sense. most authoritarian regim have democraci in that sense. nazi germani had democraci in that sense, even after the system had fundament changed. democraci onli ha substanc if there’ the rule of law. that is, if peopl believ that the vote are go to be count and they are counted. if they believ that there’ a judiciari out there that will make sens of thing if there’ some challenge. if there isn’t rule of law, peopl will be afraid to vote the way they want to vote. they'll vote for their own safeti as oppos to their convictions. so the thing we call democraci depend on the rule of law. and the thing we call the rule of law depend upon trust. law function percent of the time automatically. it function becaus we think it’ out there. and that, in turn, depend on the sens of truth. so there’ a mechan here. you can get right to heart of the matter if you can convinc peopl that there is no truth. which is whi the stuff that we character as post-modern and might dismiss is actual really, realli essential. the second thing about 'post-truth is pre-fascism' is i’m tri to get people’ attention, becaus that is actual how fascism works. fascism says, disregard the evid of your senses, disregard observation, embolden deed that can’t be proven, don’t have faith in god but have faith in leaders, take part in collect myth of an organ nation unity, and so forth. fascism wa precis about set the whole enlighten asid and then sell what sort of myth emerged. now those [national] myth are pretti unpredictable, and conting on differ nation and differ leader and so on, but to just set fact asid is actual the fastest catalyst. so that part concern me a lot. where we’r going? the classic thing to watch out for is the shift from one govern strategi to another. in the u.s. system, the typic govern strategi is you more or less have to follow your constitu with legisl becaus of the elect cycle. that’ one puls of politics. the other puls of polit is emergency. there’ some kind of terrorist attack and then the leader tri to suspend basic constitut rights. and then we get on a differ rhythm, where the rhythm is not one elector cycl to the next but one emerg to the next. that’ how regim chang take place. it’ a classic way sinc the reichstag fire [when the nazi burn their nation’ capitol build and blame communist arsonists]. so in term of what might happen next, or what peopl could look out for, some kind of event that the govern claim is a terrorist incident, would be someth to be prepar for. that’ whi it’ one of the lesson in the book. sr: you have talk befor about that kind of emerg justification—and even with vladimir putin in russia. is that what you think would happen here? becaus with the except of the judiciary, a lot of american institutions, like congress, are not realli resisting. they’r go along. ts: they’r go along… but my own intuit would be the emerg situat aris becaus go along isn’t go to be enough. paradoxically, congress is go along and is go to pass a bunch of stuff, which is not actual veri popular. right? it’ not go to be so popular to have million of peopl lose health insurance, which is what’ go to happen. the iron thing about the republican congress is now it ha the abil to do everyth it want to do, but none of what it want to do is that popular. except with the few big lobbies, of course. the freedom the republican have is the freedom to impos their agenda on down. the same thing goe with mr. trump. the thing that he might do that some peopl would like, like build a wall or drive all the immigr out, those thing are go to be difficult or slow. in the case of the wall, i person don’t believ it will ever happen. it’ go to be veri slow. so my suspicion is that it is much easier to have a dramat neg event, than have a dramat posit event. that is one of the reason i am concern about the reichstag fire scenario. the other reason is that we are be mental prepar for it by all the talk about terror and by the muslim ban. veri often when leader repeat thing over and over they are prepar you for when that meme actual emerg in reality. sr: i want to chang the topic slightly. you cite mani exampl from germani in , the year hitler consolid power. so what did ordinari german miss that’ relev for ordinari american now? i know some of thi is the blur of facts. but when i have talk to holocaust survivors, they often say, nobodi ever thought thing would be that bad, or nobodi thought the german would go as far as they did. ts: the german jew then, and peopl now, don’t understand how quick their neighbor will change; don’t understand how quickli societi can change. they don’t understand the fact that a life that’ been predict for a long time, doesn’t mean that it will be predict tomorrow. and peopl like to think that their experi is exceptional. german jew might have thought, 'well, there were pogrom [ethnic cleansing] in russia, but sure noth like that could happen here.' that’ what mani german jew thought. so one issu is peopl need to realiz how quickli thing can change. the second thing that german jew were not awar of, or german were not awar of, wa how new media can quickli chang conversations. in that way, it’ not exactli the same, but radio at that time often end up be a channel for propaganda. there are parallel with the internet now, where there were hope that it would be [primarily] enlightening. but in fact, it turn out that with presidenti tweets, or with bots, or isol habit of viewing, it isn’t necessarili enlightening. it’ the opposite. a lot of us were blindsid by the internet in much the same way that peopl could be blindsid by radio in the s. but here’ the other view. the one that we have that german jew didn’t have in is we have their experience. that’ the premis of the whole book; the premis is that the th centuri show us what can happen, and there’ lot of wonder scholarship by german historian and others, which break down what can happen and how. and so, one of the first thing that we should be do is take advantag of the one opportun that we realli have that they didn’t, which is to learn from that history. and that’ the premis of the book. sr: all of your book’ lesson are veri personal: don’t obey in advance. believ in truth. stand out. defend institutions. be calm but as courag as you can be. yet the chang or oppress that you are talk about is system and institutional. what do you say to peopl who say, 'i’ll try, but i may not have the power here.' there’ that cliche, tilt at windmills. ... ts: well, if everyon tilt against a windmill, the windmil would fall down, right? parti of the tragedi of don quixot is he’ tilt against the wrong thing. so that’ not our problem. we’r pretti sure what the problem is. but he wa also alon except for hi faith companion. we’r not realli alone. there are million and million of peopl who are look for that thing to do. just by sheer math, if everyon doe a littl thing, it will make a difference. and much of what i am recommend is—you’r right, they are thing that peopl can do, but they also involv some kind of engagement. whether it’ the small talk [with those you disagre with] or whether it’ the corpor politics. and that littl bit of engag help you realiz that what you are do ha a kind of sense, even if it doesn’t immedi chang the order. and finally, a lot of the polit theori that i am call upon, which come from the anti-nazi and the anti-communists, make the point that even though you don’t realiz it, your own exampl matter a whole lot, whether it’ posit or negatively. there are times, and thi is one of those times, where small gestures, or their absence, can make a huge difference. so the thing that might not have matter a year ago do matter now. the basic thing is we are make a differ whether we realiz it or not, and the basic question is whether it is posit or negative. let me put it a differ way. except for realli dramat moments, most of the time authoritarian depend on some kind of cycl involv a popular consent of some form. it realli doe matter how we behave. the danger is [if] we say, 'well, we don’t see how it matters, and so therefor we are go to just tabl the whole question.' if we do that, then we start to slide along and start do the thing that the author expect of us. which is whi lesson number one is: don’t obey in advance. you have to set the tabl differently. you have to say, 'thi is a situat in which i need to think for myself about all of the thing that i am go to do and not just punt. not just wait. nor just see how thing seem to me. becaus if you do that, then you chang and you actual becom part of the regim chang toward authoritarianism.' sr: you cite in the book someth i read in high school: eugen ionesco’ existenti play about fascism, rhinoceros, where peopl talk about their colleagu at work, in academia, say stuff like, 'come on, i don’t agre with everything, but give him a chance.' ionesco’ point is that peopl join an unthink herd befor they know it. what would you suggest peopl do, when they run into other who fall on thi spectrum? ts: there are a few question here. one is how to keep yourself going. anoth is how to energ other peopl who agre with you. and the third thing is not quit rhinocero stuff, but how to catch peopl who are slipping. like that cnn coverag last week of the speech to congress, where one of the cnn comment said, 'oh, now thi is presidential.' that wa a rhinocero moment, becaus there wa noth presidential—it wa atroci to parad the victim of crime commit by one ethnicity. that wa atroci and there’ noth presidenti about it. catch rhinocero moment is one thing. i think it’ realli import to think about. the exampl that ionesco give is peopl saying, 'yeah, on one hand, with the jews, mayb they are right.' with trump, peopl will say someth like, 'yeah, but on taxes, mayb he’ right.' and the thing to catch is, 'yeah, but are you in favor of regim change? are you in favor of the end of the american way of democraci and fair play?' becaus that’ what’ realli at stake. with peopl all the way over at the end of the spectrum who are now confid about trump—that’ a differ subject. i think it’ import to maintain imposs human relat across that divide, becaus some of those peopl are go to chang their minds. it’ harsh. but some will chang their minds, and if they have no one to talk to, it will be much harder for them to chang their minds. at differ point on the spectrum, you have to think in differ ways. my own major concern right now is with self-confid and the energi of the peopl who do have the deep—and, i think incorrect—convict that someth ha gone wildli wrong. sr: the peopl who have the convict that someth ha gone wildli wrong—that can describ trump support and trump opponents. ts: that’ a good point. so much of thi is personal. in the book, i don’t actual mention anybody’ name, except the thinker who i admire. so much of thi is person that peopl think, 'well, if you say anyth critical, it is about you as a person, and how you don’t like anyth about someon who like trump.' that’ a way for there to be no polit discussion. i think it’ useful, even though you will never win the argument, when you are talk about peopl who support to the administration, to stay at the level of the constitution. to stay at the level of freedom, or stay at the level of basic issues, like, is global warm realli go to be so great, when the entir pentagon say that it is a nation secur threat? or, is it realli such a good idea to treat muslim like this? or, is it realli go to be so good when million of peopl lose health insurance? keep it at the level of issu as much as possible, becaus what i’v found is the pattern that peopl shift to is, 'whi are you go to be so hard on thi guy? give him a chance.' but the issu of what’ constitutional, what is actual american, and what’ go to be a polici that they are go to be proud of a year from now—keep the convers closest to the constitution. it’ easiest to be dismiss when it’ personal. and fundamentally, thi is the trick. it isn’t personal. it doesn’t matter who’ in charge. what matter is the system, which peopl of veri differ convict take for granted, is now under threat. sr: you have said that the muslim are be target as the jew were target in germany. but out here in california, it also feel like the deport machineri is get readi for undocu immigrants. on monday, reuter report that homeland secur offici said they might separ mother from kid when make arrests. germani did that as it round up jews. don’t they face just as grave a threat? ts: with the muslims, the resembl to anti-semit polici in germani in ’ is that if you can pick some group and make them stand in for some intern threat, then you can chang domest politics, becaus domest polit then is no longer about compromis and compet interests, domest polit is about who insid the societi should actual be seen and outsid the society. onc you get the wedg in with the first group, them you essenti win. it could be the muslims. it could be somebodi else, is the point. the polit logic is basic the same. with undocu immigrants, i think the logic might be a littl bit different. i think the goal might be to get us use to see a certain kind of polic power. and get us use to see thing happen to peopl in public. and then if we get use to that, then we might be more will for the dial to turn a littl bit further. it’ too soon for me to specul confid about all of this. i think you’r right though, it could be the muslims, but it doesn’t have to be the muslims. the crucial thing is to get some kind of in [polit opening] where peopl go along with or accept stigmatization. and the logic is there’ alway some kind of threat that come from beyond the country. and that we can fix that threat on a group of peopl insid the country. and if you go along with this, what els are you agre to go along with? sr: to go back to your book, what you’r say is that peopl should be vigilant, should know their valu and particip at some level with make those valu known, becaus that is what ordinari peopl can do. ts: yes. the point of the book is [that] we are face a real crisi and a real moment of choice. the possibl are much darker than american are use to considering. but at the same time, what we can do is much more import than we realize. the regim will onli chang if the gambl of the peopl in the white hous is right: that mani of us despis mani other of us and that most of us are indifferent. if it turn out that there are emot and valu that are more numer and more vibrant than indiffer and hatred, thing are go to be okay. that depend on us. that depend on us make certain realizations. it depend on us act fast. in that sens it’ a test, not just collectively. mayb there’ no such thing as a collect test. but it is a test for us individually. most american who haven’t been abroad haven't been face by someth like this. and hope they won’t be face with it again. but we are face with it as citizen and as individuals. and i think, five or year from now, no matter how thing turn out, we’ll ask ourselves—or our children will ask us—how we behav in .",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"If We Don't Act Now, Fascism Will Be on Our Doorstep, Says Yale Historian",,,[''],"Timothy Snyder warns: History gives us a bunch of cases where democratic republics became authoritarian regimes.

again: “thi kind of carnag can happen all over europe” headline: bitcoin & blockchain search exceed trump! blockchain stock are next! thi articl wa origin publish by michael snyder at hi econom collaps blog. editor’ note: it wa alway just a matter of time, sinc the whole european fiasco wa mere patch over after the last round. all the new power given to the european bank (and all the king’ hors and men) couldn’t put it back togeth again, and couldn’t stop what wa inevit under the exist condit – greec ha been a tick time bomb and thing closer to disast than ever. everyon alreadi know how bad thing stand to becom if it play out at it worst, so get ready. a grexit may be in the near future, a brexit is still veri possible, and anoth round of global financi titan could be in the works. time will tell… the next great european financi crisi ha begun the greek financi system is in the process of total imploding, and the rest of europ will soon follow. neither the greek nor the german are will to give in, and that mean that there is veri littl chanc that a debt deal is go to happen by the end of june. so that mean that we will like see a major greek debt default and potenti even a greek exit from the eurozone. at thi point, credit default swap on greek debt have risen percent in price sinc the begin of thi year, and the market ha price in a percent chanc that a greek debt default will happen. over the past month, the yield on two year greek bond ha skyrocket from percent to more than percent, and the greek stock market ha fallen by a total of percent dure the last three trade day alone. thi is what a financi collaps look like, and if greec doe leav the euro, we are go to see thi kind of carnag happen all over europe. offici over in europ are now openli speak of the need to prepar for a “state of emergency” now that negoti have total collapsed. at one time, it would have been unthink for greec to leav the euro, but now it appear that thi is precis what will happen unless a miracl happens… greec is head for a state of emerg and an exit from the euro follow the collaps of talk to agre a bailout deal, senior eu offici warn last night. europ must be prepar to step in otherwis greek societi would face an unpreced crisi with power blackouts, medicin shortag and no money to pay for police, they said. in the past, the greek have alway buckl under pressure. but thi new greek govern wa elect with a mandat to end austerity, and so far they have shown a remark amount of resolve. in order for a debt deal to happen, one side is go to have to blink, and at thi point it doe not look like it will be the greeks… the world’ financi market are face up to the possibl that greec could soon becom the first countri to crash out of europe’ singl currency. talk between athen and it eurozon creditor have collaps in acrimoni just day befor a final deadlin for greec to unlock the €.bn (£.bn) in bailout fund it need to avoid a catastroph debt default. the greek prime minister, alexi tsipras, accus the creditor power of hidden “polit motives” in their demand that greec make further cut to public pension payment in return for the financi aid. “we are shoulder the digniti of our people, as well as the hope of the peopl of europe,” mr tsipra said in a defiant statement. “we cannot ignor thi responsibility. thi is not a matter of ideolog stubbornness. thi is about democracy.” as we approach the point of no return, both side are prepar for the endgame. in greece, member of parliament have been studi what happen in iceland a few year ago. mani of them believ that a greek debt default combin with a nation of greek bank and a greek exit from the euro could set the nation back on the path to prosper fairli rapidly. the follow come from the telegraph… the radic wing of greece’ syriza parti is to tabl plan over come day for an icelandic-styl default and a nationalis of the greek bank system, deem it pointless to continu talk with europe’ creditor powers. syriza sourc say measur be draft includ capit control and the establish of a sovereign central bank abl to stand behind a new financi system. while some form of dual currenc might be possibl in theory, such a structur would be incompat with euro membership and would impli a rapid return to the drachma. the confidenti plan were circul over the weekend and have the back of mp from the aristeri platforma or ‘left platform’, as well as other hard-lin group in syriza’ spectrum. it is understood that the nationalist anel parti in the rule coalit is also will to forc a ruptur with creditors, if need be. meanwhile, in a desper attempt to get the greek to give in at the last moment, greek’ creditor are prepar to pull out all the stop in order to put as much financi pressur on greec as possible… germany’ suddeutsch zeitung report that the creditor are draw an ultimatum to the greeks, threaten to cut off greek access to the european payment system and forc capit control on the countri as soon as thi weekend. the plan would lead to the temporari closur of the banks, follow by a ration of cash withdrawals. for a long time, most in the financi world assum that a debt deal would eventu happen. but now realiti is set in. as i mention at the top of thi article, the cost to insur greek debt ha risen by an astound percent sinc the begin of thi year… given these dramat stakes, the risk of a greek default ha gone way up. one way to measur that risk is by look at the skyrocket price of insur polici that would pay out if greek bond go bust. the cost to insur greek debt for one year against the risk of default ha skyrocket % sinc the start of the , accord to factset data. these insurance-lik contracts, known as credit default swaps, impli there is a % to % probabl of greec default on it debt, accord to jigar patel, a credit strategist at barclays. the probabl of a greek default soar to a whop % for five-year cds, patel said. “default is look more and more likely,” peter boockvar, chief market analyst at the lindsey group, wrote in a note to client on tuesday. and in recent days, we have also seen greek stock and greek bond total crash. the follow come from cnn… the greek stock market ha plummet % over the past three trade days, includ a % drop on tuesday alone. in the bond market, the yield on greek two-year debt ha skyrocket to .%. a month ago, the yield wa onli %. yield rise as bond price fall. of cours if there is a greek debt default and greec doe leav the euro, it won’t just be greec that pay the price. as i have written about previously, there are ten of trillion of dollar in deriv that are directli tie to currenc exchang rate and trillion dollar in deriv that are directli tie to interest rates. a “grexit” would caus the euro to drop like a rock and interest rate all over the contin would start to go crazy. the financi chao that a “grexit” would caus should not be underestimated. and there are sign that some of europe’ biggest bank are alreadi on the verg of collapse. for example, just consid what ha been go on at the biggest bank in germany. both of the co-ceo at deutsch bank recent resigned, and it is increasingli look as if it could soon becom europe’ version of lehman brothers. the follow summari of the recent troubl at deutsch bank come from an articl that wa post on notquant… here’ a re-cap of what’ happen at deutsch

178,27373,undergroundhealth.com,unknown,https://www.undergroundhealth.com/understanding-what-authentic-happiness-is/,"by giovani – liveanddare.com are you truli happy? is happi a pass feel or a state of be for you? ton of articl (and books) have been written about how to be happy, and there is some good inform out there. i have read and synthesis hundr of hour of research and experi here for you, in thi action-driven article. what you will find is some deep, life-chang stuff. if you think that all talk about “how to be happy” is fluffi materi and common sense, you are in it for a change. there is a theori in psycholog call the hedon treadmill, which say that great event (like win a lottery) and terribl event (like lose a leg) can happen in your life, but after a while you are alway back to your “baselin happiness”. if that is true, then more import than tri to chang your extern life is to actual improv your baselin happiness. thi is the focu of thi articl – and not “feel happy” strategies. each item here is conclud with a suggest action step. and at the end of the post you will find a link to download a pdf with all of them ? understand what authent happi is is happi a feel or a state of being? what is it nature, and what are it causes? wikipedia defin happi as “a mental or emot state of well-b character by posit or pleasant emot rang from content to intens joy”. there can never be, ani object measur of happi base on extern achievements. it is an interpret of reality, and not a result of reality. actually, happi is such a load term, that i wonder if it is the right one for what we are truli seeking. i person prefer to speak of fulfillment, contentment, and well-being. the greeks, on the other hand, spoke of eudamonia, the “well-liv life” the problem seem to be understand what caus human be to continu experi thi state. my research and self-experi have led me to believ (that) there are three “kinds” of happiness: personal, transpersonal, (and) transcendental. person happiness. most peopl live by the belief that happi is simpli the result of accumul as mani pleasur moment as possible, and of fulfil one’ desires. money, possessions, food, fun, sex, fame, power. here is both the trap of “live as if there is no tomorrow” (the hedonist blind focu in the present) and “live in hope of a better tomorrow” (put off happi to the achiev of a futur goal). the problem with thi is that the pursuit of these pleasur and achiev can often be a pain and frustrat process (that is, an unhappi process). besides, the happy-feel result from these achiev is short-liv and usual less gloriou than the promis (see havard psychologist daniel gilbert on “miswanting” ). on top of that, in mani case we must fight hard to keep what wa gained. finally, even if we are those rare be that can alway easili get and keep what we want, without much pain associate(d) with it, the inevit result after a while is boredom and indifference. not realli the definit of a fulfil life, right? sound more like an ocean of trouble, with some island of happi feelings. the verb for person happi are: “to get”, “to feel”, “to achieve”. transperson happiness. scientif research in the field of posit psychology, pioneer by dr. martin seligman, phd, propos that a higher “zone” of happi is to use one’ uniqu qualiti and perspect in the servic of someth larger than oneself. thi “higher cause” can revolv around family, community, science, art, world reform, spiritu transformation, etc.here, happi is more of a process, a continuum. a path, rather than an event. and becaus it caus is larger than one’ ego, so is the result joy. have a look at the perma model of happi to learn more. the verb for transperson happi are: “to do”, “to grow”, “to impact” transcendent happiness. a more uncommon view of happiness, propos by mani eastern traditions, is that it is our natur state of being. our true self. if it is natur to us, whi then is it not experi always? just like health is inher to our bodi but is disturb by bad habit and bad food, happi is inher to our heart but disturb by neg mindsets. the verb for transcendent happi are: “to be”, “to discover”, “to transform”. these three “kinds” are not self-excluding. each one ha it place and you can have it all. readi to explor what are the caus of true well-b and last satisfact in life? let’ do this! part – the essenti . discov your true valu the singl most import element in live a fulfil life is understand your true person values, and align you exist to them. by “values” i don’t mean person qualiti like “honesty” and “integrity” – i mean those activ & goal that most consum your soul. it is what you are hungri for. those thing that you love to think about, read about, talk about, learn about. exampl of values: family, build your career, athlet performance, art, spirituality, travelling, be a thought leader, develop your business, etc. it’ more of a doing, not a having. how to discov your values? take some minut to look deeper into yourself and your life, and it will tell you where you natur focu your valuabl resourc (time, energy, money, attention). actual take the time to do this. here are some guid questions: how do you spend your free time? how do you spend your money? what in your life are you most reliable, disciplin and focused? what do you most think about and dream about? what do you love to learn, read about, and explore? what inspir you the most? fast forward your life year and look back. you are proud of achiev one thing. what is that? the element that appear repeatedli are your core values. it is here that you will find your passion, your direction. they are your map for everi singl decis in your life. your map for a happi life. thi is such a deep topic that it deserv a post of itself (and probabl will get). for now, to learn more about core values, i highli recommend the book the breakthrough experience, by dr. john f. demartini, an expert in thi field. action step: give yourself ~ minut to contempl on those question and discov your core - values. if you are busi now, put in some time in your calendar for later ? . how to be happy? align your life to your valu your happi is where your valu are. it is what we want to do, what make us alive. the more your daili thought and activ are in harmoni with your values, the happier you are. thi is also one of the power tool of coaches. now put your valu in order, with the most import one on top. and examin how much juic they are get in the differ aspect of your life. how much money, time, and energi are you spend on them? are they activ direct your life, your daili choices? or are they be suffoc and forgotten in the maze of the practic of live and other less import things? how can your authent self be more in the steer wheel of your life? action step: understand how much your core valu are direct your life or not. commit to make simpl chang to increas their power. . leav asid the unessenti – the art of say “no” are you feel overwhelm with tasks? mayb lack headspace, or direct in life? then you might have said ye to mani thing that are not truli essential, or not in harmoni with your person values. therefore, there is no space to move, or not enough energi to build what is realli meaning for you. that extra project you took; the extra credit card; the relationship you are keep and you don’t realli care about; the stuff you bought and don’t realli need; the old habit that are lurk around but have no mean anymore. when make decisions, everi “yes” is a commit to something, and a closur to other things. it is allow someth – an activity, a place, a person, a task – to occupi valuabl resourc in your life. you can produc more money, but the time spent on someth or someon will never come back. say “yes” to anyth also demand our commit of energi and headspac (an increasingli rare commod these days). the inabl to say no is actual root in fear. fear of miss out an opportunity; fear of close a door that we can never again reopen. but we simpli cannot have it all. and we fail to see that thi fear is actual the veri caus that make us close mani other doors. to explor more on this, check out dan ariely’ classic predict irrational. “i thi thing i`m think of say ‘yes’ to gonna support my core valu or not?”, “how is thi decis affect my present and futur self?” answer these questions, from moment to moment, is the human journey. in simpl terms, our life, impact, and well-being, is determin by what we say ye to. it is a collect of yese and nos. “no” is not a neg word. it is not aggressive. it is not rejection. it is not selfish. it is focus. “no” is a power word, and can be use powerfully. all genius of human – in art, sport, politics, literature, scienc – were say “yes” to a few things, and “no” to everyth else. they were not chase the next shine object. “i don’t know the key to success, but the key to failur is tri to pleas everybody” (bill cosby) the contempl of our finit nature, of limitation, of death, push human be to accomplish extraordinari things, to live amaz lives. that is whi mani peopl that go through near-death experi have their life transformed. for the better. they stop say ye to thing that don’t realli matter to them, and start focus on what is realli important. that is whi the movement of minim is gain traction in modern society. for more on thi topic, i recommend joshua becker’ blog, becom minimalist, and thi ted talk. the foundat of a “happi life”, therefore, is to discov our core values, align our life and action to them, and religi say “no” to all the needless thing that are not in service. trust your heart and your gut if you feel that a person or activ is simpli not for you. action step: write down thing you want to start say “no” to in life. take note of what you are lose (time, energy, money, head space) by allow those thing to creep in. . act base on creativ freedom – not condit sinc birth we have been expos to so much condit – from our family, friends, society, media, environment. and still continu to be bombard by thousand of messag everi day. these outsid voic have been heard and repeat so mani time that they start have an independ life insid of us. no wonder it is hard to find our true voice, as oppos to the voic of other people’ opinions. yet, we onli find fulfil and freedom by follow our own uniqu voic – our “person legend”, as paulo coelho would have it. so what to do? the key is to discov what our core valu are. thi process can take time to matur in us. take some time alone, apart from all that is familiar from us, can help. meditation, travel & retreat can give us the space to discov ourselves. a life coach can also be of service. accord to australian nurs bronni ware, who spent mani year work with patient on their last week of life, the top regret of the die is “i wish i’d had the courag to live a life true to myself, not the life other expect of me.” your valu will be your rule of thumb when decid what is your voic and what is conditioning. action step: next time you feel unsur what path to take, use your core valu to discern your true path from your conditioning. be determin to act base on your higher good, and not base on what you believ you “should do”. . live the present, but don’t hunt the short-term be exclus present-ori or futur orient are both point of unbal to be in the trap that “i`ll be happi when…” is a caus of unhappiness. to be miss or sacrif the present – the beauti nature, the human relations, the rest needed, the peac and joy of be here and breath – is a caus of unhappiness. believ happi to be “in the future” is not onli a riski assumption, but also betray the concept of happi as a state of being. it is not in the achiev of your goal – it is in the process of live your values. but to live as if there is no tomorrow, to focu onli on short-term goal is the other extrem of thi scale. and is not sustain either. in hi classic book, emot intelligence, daniel goleman describ an experi in which four-year old kid are left in a room alon and told they can have two marshmallow if they wait for the experiment to return from an errand. if they can’t wait till then, they can have onli one marshmallow, but they can have it now. some kid were abl to hold off the fifteen to twenti minut while other jump on the one marshmallow – almost alway within seconds. year later the same kid were interviewed, and goleman discov that their abil to delay gratif reveal a great deal about the trajectori that child would like take in their lives. the scholar conclud that “there is perhap no psycholog skill more fundament than resist impulse.” it is curiou that mani time our success in the short-term is exactli the reason of our failur in the long-term. live day by day with a higher direct in mind, yet with our feet on the ground, seem to be the balanc point between present and future. a balanc between enjoy the now and design the future. action step: take note of thing that you are sacrif in your present, for the promis of a better future. then write down place in your life where your focu on short-term goal may be harm the long-term direct you want for your life. you now know what tweak you can make so you can be both more present, and also focus on the right things. . don’t chase extrins valu while focu on extrins life valu may lead to a quicker satisfact of these desires, true fulfil will not be found down thi path. on the other hand, there are countless testimoni of peopl that focus first on the “import stuff” in life and, as a result, also got the extrins goal met. there is a lot of research in thi sense. phd professor ronald inglehart, found that onc middle-class comfort are in place, the link between wealth and wellb “i surprisingli weak (indeed, virtual negligible).” in hi best-sel book on the scienc of motivation,whi we do what we do, edward deci tell us: “the research found that if ani of the three extrins aspir – for money, fame, or beauti – wa veri high for an individu rel to the three intrins aspirations, the individu wa also more like to display poorer mental health. for example, have an unusu strong aspir for materi success wa associ with narcissism, anxiety, depression, and poorer social function as rate by a train clinic psychologist…in contrast, strong aspir for ani of the intrins goal – meaning relationships, person growth, and commun contribut – were posit associ with well-being. peopl who strongli desir to contribut to their community, for example, had more vital and higher self-esteem. when peopl organ their behavior in term of intrins strive (rel to extrins strivings) they seem more content – they feel better about who they are and display more evid of psycholog health.” action step: review your core values. what is drive you in life? are these extrins valu or intrins values? if they are extrinsic, what is the bigger valu behind them? . be care how you feed your sens our bodi is fed by food, water, and other elements; our mind is fed through idea and the five senses. the qualiti of our mind and intern wellb is profoundli form by the thing we see, listen to, watch, smell, touch, read, think about, etc. how are you feed your senses? the music you choos to hear affect your moods. depend on the genre, it can make you inspired, calm, emotional; or violent, depressed, confused. the same goe with the movi we watch, book we read, and all other type of media, environment, food (here and here), and people. action step: make a list of the top five thing that you are feed your sens and do not serv your wellbeing. reflect whether you realli need these thing in your life or not. commit to one small change. . find a place of flow “flow” is that beauti state of total integr in your present activity. you are there with your whole body, mind and soul, and it as if you disappear, and there is noth els in the world. total concentration. mayb it is when you are running, or read a great book, or give a speech, or drawing. perhap when think deepli about some matter, or when meditating. differ peopl access the flow accord to their own passion. it is what move artists, athletes, writers, and entrepreneur to give their whole selv into their project. it is also one of the cornerston of the daoist philosophy. mihali csikszentmihalyi, author of find flow, and one of the pioneer in thi research, wrote: “in all the activ peopl in our studi report engag in, enjoy come at a veri specif point: whenev the opportun for action perceiv by the individu are equal to hi or her capabilities. play tennis, for instance, is not enjoy if the two oppon are mismatched. the less skill player will feel anxious, and the better player will feel bored. the same is true for everi other activity… enjoy appear at the boundari between boredom and anxiety, when the challeng are just balanc with the person’ capac to act.” to expand on thi topic, check out thi articl on the blog pursuit-of-happiness. action step: what are the activ in your life that you are more like to find flow? how can you deepen your involv in these activities? . nurtur your spiritu sever studi point out the relationship between spiritu develop and person well-being. a review of more than studi of mainli adult popul found that out of those studies, (%) found onli posit associ between religiosity/spiritu and well-being. for some people, spiritu come through their religion; but spiritu and religion are differ things. you can be spiritu without be religi – that is, without join ani religion or church. spiritu doe not requir you do give your power away to some extern person or institution, nor to have blind faith; it is not dogmat nor ritualistic. it is not a cult. it doe not limit your freedom and it doe not make you close minded. as a side note, there studi that show benefit of medit regardless of belief or religi inclination. true spiritu is an invit to look deeper into your life, your values, and discov your true self. explor thi topic more in-depth will be a subject of other posts. for now, you can start by read some medit quotes. action step: start look for way to develop your spirituality, a deeper perspect and valu in life. . master your mind buddhism and other ancient tradit emphasis that our mind can be our greatest friend or our worst enemy. it can make our life heaven or hell. “more than those who hate you, more than all your enemies, an undisciplin mind doe greater harm.” – the buddha there is no doubt about thi – there can be no happi while we are enslav by our own shadows. no factor seem to be more import for our wellb than the state of our minds. and yet, for the averag person up to % of one thought is neg self-talk. thi lead to emot overload and stress. “ok, i get it”, i hear you say, “but how to control the mind?”. thing is, you cannot control the first thought that aris in the mind in ani given situat – that is simpli a condit response. but you can exercis control over the second thought and the one after. here lie your power (and responsibility). for example, i`m sit in the couch in a sunday afternoon and the thought aris “i`m lonely”. whether i “accept” thi and continu on thi train of thought (“yeah, nobodi love me…”, etc.) or simpli let it pass, it my choice. i can also choos to instead think “yes, i`m alon at thi moment, but it good, i need some self-space”. one way lead to anxiety, victim and self-piti – the other doesn’t. thousand of time per day we make choic like this, although most time it is automat and we are not awar of it. becom awar of our mind process and exercis our power to direct our attent is the masteri of the mind. and thi is greatli facilit by practic such as medit and mindfulness. there are also techniqu develop by psychologists. the message, here, is that the way you feel, the way you think, is not a necessity. it is mere a learn habit. it is, in great part, arbitrary. you have the power to chang it. you are give power to your thought by think them, by engag in a convers with them, and believ them. if they are creat suffering, rememb that you have the power to think someth different. the mind cannot hold on to two opposit feel at the same time, so focus on develop posit thought pattern and emot alreadi goe a long way. watch mathieu ricard (ex-phd scientist turn monk) expand on this. action step: becom awar of your intern dialogs. be vigil of your neg thoughts. next time neg think kick in, exercis your power to redirect your thought to someth else, to reinterpret the facts, or to simpli ignore. in the begin you will succeed onli for a few seconds. with practic and persistence, however, it becom natur and easy. part – mindset & attitud some mindset empow a life of success and fulfilment; other creat difficulti and pain. these can be learn by experi (the hard way), by read good person develop material, by engag with mentor and life coaches, or by reflect and meditation. here are my find from these learn paths. . face everyth as an opportun to grow. thi is probabl the most empow attitud i’v ever encountered. it is a good medicin against mani of the caus of fear, frustration, impatience, anxiety, and stress. if you face everi event, everi challenge, as part of the way, then noth can disturb you. you will not fear, nor complain, nor blame, nor be piss off by thing that happen. instead, in your mind there will be onli the question: “what can i learn from this?”. an event doesn’t mean anyth by itself; it is alway onli what you make of it. you have the power to make it posit or negative. you get a “no” as an answer. your car breaks. it’ rain on a sunday again. you can’t finish your project. got sick. nobodi is buy your product. your son doesn’t listen to you. you can resist these things. close yourself up. fight them. you now have a problem, and that is unfortunate. or you can be open. breath deeply. acknowledg what is there. look for your lesson, and for the next step. you now simpli have a new context, and that is an opportunity. perform psychologist john eliot, author of the somewhat controversi overachievement, ha a veri interest expression: “eat stress like an energi bar”. yes, even emot like stress, anger, envy, can be use for someth positive, as motiv for action. depend on our attitud these energi can be empow or disempowering. life’ challeng are polish you, prepar you for bigger things. action step: next time a challeng comes, kiss it face, learn the lesson, and move on. . expect creat disappoint expect is wish think about the future. it set a self-impos standard of what is to happen. a bit like draw a line on the sand and decid that “if it is abov thi line i`ll be happy; if not, i`ll be upset”. some expect are natural, and not as harmful. when i buy a product from the supermarket, i expect it to not be rotten, and will have an unpleas surpris if it is. other expectations, however, are just a recip for disaster. for instance, expect thing to be easi when learn something, or work on my business, or tri to navig through life, will creat a lot of frustration. if, instead, i expect thing to be hard, i’ll be well prepared. if they turn out to be easy, i`m happy; if they turn out to be hard… well, no surpris here. after all, usual what is worth have doesn’t come easy. similarly, hope to get lucky, to be accepted, to have quick success, to have no conflict – all these expect bring about pain. we’d be better off just do what we need to do and leav the futur to take care of itself. while it may be imposs to live without ani expect at all, when we learn to be more conserv and “soft” about our expectations, we suffer less the consequ of their violation. keep in mind that they are arbitrari and self-imposed, we tend to have more flexibl and flow. manag your expectations, and you will rare be disappointed. check out also the creat post about the subject on lifehacker, huffington post and tini buddha. action step: what needless expect are you impos on yourself right now? do you realli need them? . yesterday is graveyard… how to forget the past and reinvent your histori victimization, remorse, guilt, regret. no doubt these are unhappi feelings, and they all have someth in common: they are anchor in the past. what are you dwell on? your past failures? a betrayal? a gaff you made on the last dinner party? someth unjust that happen to you? the past is good for one thing only: learning. we need to reflect on what ha happened, learn from it, and move on. your past doe not defin you – unless you allow it to. you are not what ha happen to you; you are what you choos to become. you mind defin you. and mind creat what it constantli think about. suddenli over think the past doesn’t sound like a good idea anymore… it is usual pain (and not pleasure), that keep us look back. the desir to “correct” the past is one of the main reason whi we get stuck in it. and yet thi desir goe against a basic law of nature. if we reflect deepli about how thi tendenc is hurt our present, how it is hinder our life here and now, we will have the motiv need to make a decis to let go and stop look back. of course, if possibl it also help to get physic apart from place and peopl who take you back to your past. anoth approach is to actual reinvent your past. yes, it is possible, and it is not hallucination. the fact is, the past that we rememb is what we have subject experienced, not the raw facts. it is the fact + our thinking/feeling. it is not reality, but rather our colour descript of it – and we have the power to chang this. if somebodi did someth bad to us, we cannot start believ that they simpli didn’t do that (we actual can, but that’ delusional); but we can chang our belief about what that mean to us. and that basic chang everything, becaus for the rest of our life we will rememb our stori of the event, it’ ending, and not the experi of the event. morti lefkoe, author of the best-sel re-creat your life, teach a process that can be use to reinterpret past event in a simpl way: identifi the undesir pattern name the underli belief identifi the sourc of the belief in memory, includ as much sensori detail as possibl describ possibl altern interpret of the memori realiz that your origin belief is an interpretation, not realiti conscious choos to reject the origin belief as “false” conscious choos to accept your reinterpret as “true” both interpret are valid. your realiti will be defin by the one you choos to accept. your choice. action step: identifi where in your past you usual get stuck in, and go through the reinterpret process. . accept the thing you cannot control or chang whether we like it or not, mani thing in life we cannot change. we cannot chang other people, nor the behaviour of the market. other thing can be changed, but onli with coloss effort dure a long period of time. accept realiti is not a passiv attitude. it doe not make us weak. it doe requir humility, of course, but it empow us to respond to life in a wiser, more effective, way. we cannot fight all battles. so let’ choos wise what to accept, and what to focu to change. action step: are you struggl to accept some major realiti in yourself or your life? what would happen if instead of ask “how can i chang this” you ask “how can i make use of this?” . move in the direct of your fear yes, you read that right. have thi determin that no fear must aris unmet. have thi obsess that everi fear must be confront and conquered. thi unleash of your inner hero will deepen your life and broaden your heart. fear is one of the most instinct human emotions. it can take mani forms, such as worri (fear about futur circumstances), doubt (fear about make the wrong choice) and hatr (the aggress respons to the fear object). most like you will experi it your whole life, so it might be a good idea to learn how to deal with it. the problem is not that fear arises. the problem, if any, is how you respond to it. yes, believ it or not, you have total freedom as to how to respond. mayb it is hard to experi it, becaus you might not have exercis thi mind-muscl much. but it’ there. experienc danger & risk, can be charact build as well. even for your kids. a smooth sea never made a skill sailor. and skill sailor have a depth in their live that novic don’t. happi are those that are bigger than their fears. and how to be bigger than your fear? act bigger than your fear. when in doubt, close your eye and take the leap. don’t cling to someth just becaus of fear. it make you a prisoner. hey! fear is not a big deal. just some electr impuls in your brain, coupl with a bit of chemic run through your blood. will thi keep you powerless while life run you by? action step: think of someth that make you afraid. take one small step everi day in the direct of that fear. it’ import that it be a small step, otherwis you may lose motivation. feel the confid that come from act despit the fear. gradual increas the bold of your actions. . embrac imperman not understand and accept imperman is a caus of unhappiness. imperman is the fundament law of our existence. thi is the onli thing that is certain in thi life: everyth changes. time eat away everything, and noth remain the same. your time will be spent. money will be gone. mani thing that you care about will either disappear, or you will no longer care about them. the good news is that whatev neg feel or unpleas situat you are experienc will also pass. there wa a time when it did not exist; then it show up for a limit time, and after that it goe back to not existing. sever ancient tradit emphasis the need to contempl the fleet natur of our lives, from buddha to the stoic (who call thi exercis memento mori). a deeper life open up when we understand and embrac imperman and our mortality, and learn it lessons. a deep (and often unnoticed) fear in our heart is releas onc we accept imperman down to our bones. as a result we get more focused, and we are freed up to live a more amaz life. action step: spend some time reflect about how everyth constantli changes. think of someth that you are veri attach to, or a situat that is bother you. realiz that thi too shall pass. . happi thought – choos optimism, choos happi yes, wellb and happi is a matter of choice. “habit of think need not be forever. one of the most signific find in psycholog in the last twenti year is that individu can choos the way they think.” – martin seligman from learn optim in thi wonder book the author explain the differ between optim and the (much in vogue) “posit thinking”: the former is learn a new set of cognit skills, while the later is repeat “posit affirmations” to yourself. and the skill we need to learn is that of chang our “explanatori styles”, which is how we chose to talk to ourselv when interpret what’ happening. the follow experi wa made with two dogs. the first dog is slightli shock but ha a lever he can push to stop the shocks. he quickli learn to stop the shocks. he’ in good “psychological” shape. a second dog doe not have a lever, so he can’t stop the shocks. hi shock stop onli when the first dog hit hi lever. so, in effect, the shock are random for him. our second dog “learns” that he is helpless in the face of these shocks. here’ what’ fascinating: the dog are then move to a new area and taught a new way to avoid the shocks. so, now they can both avoid the shock at will. remarkably, although the first dog avoid the shocks, the second dog curl up in the corner and whimper as the shock – which he could have avoid – is administered. he ha learn helplessness. the second dog may feel sorri for himself. he may blame the first dog. he may complain. all of these are disempowering. or he may learn to see thing differently. we condit ourselv through our own self-talk, and then becom prison of our interpretations, and blind to reality. whether you tell yourself that you can or can’t, you are right. that is whi if you want to creat instant chang in your life, watch your self-languag seem a great place to start. how you describ your realiti is how you defin it, how you creat it. here is the model the author propos for an optimist explanatori style: perman – is what happen like to continue? optimist think that if it’ a bad thing it’ a fluke. if it’ a good thing, they tend to think it’ permanent. the opposit hold true for the pessimist: good thing are the fluke and bad thing are more like to recur. – is what happen like to continue? optimist think that if it’ a bad thing it’ a fluke. if it’ a good thing, they tend to think it’ permanent. the opposit hold true for the pessimist: good thing are the fluke and bad thing are more like to recur. pervas – doe it reflect your whole life? is it “universal” or is it “specific”? with a good event, the optimist is more like to extend it to her whole life. with a bad event, she will tend to isol the incid as specif to that situation. the opposit hold true for the pessimist. – doe it reflect your whole life? is it “universal” or is it “specific”? with a good event, the optimist is more like to extend it to her whole life. with a bad event, she will tend to isol the incid as specif to that situation. the opposit hold true for the pessimist. personalis – is it intern or external? someth good happens. an optimist pat himself on the back (internal), think he did a good job. if the same thing happen to a pessimist, he is more like to attribut the success to luck, other people’ hard work, or someth els outsid of hi control (external). how we interpret event can maximis happi and energ us, or make us feel terrible. and the good news is: it’ in our power to decide. it is an emot intellig skill that can be developed. of course, mani situat in life call for a dose of pessimism, caution, and “defens thinking”, so our optim should not blind us either. like anyth in excess, irrat optim is also harm – though arguabl less harm than irrat pessimism. so mayb thi section should be call “choos balanc optimism”. true optim is more a reaction to the present than an expect about the future. it is not about blindli believ that thing will alway turn out he best. that violat the principl of manag your expect (see point ). true optim is about choos to interpret event in a posit light when they do happen. and not be attach to past neg talk. it is be open that anyth can happen, yet at the same time confid that “i can do someth posit with anyth that comes”. there are sever studi on how be optimist posit affect physic and mental health (, ), romant relationships, athlet performance, career, busi and the economy. check out thi articl to read more on optim & posit psychology, and thi one about how happi is also a deliber choice. action step: identifi three place in your life you are have neg self-talk. how could you have a more empow interpret of that situation? is the neg self-talk base on realiti now, or mere learn habit? . be wrong need to be right all the time can be extrem limit and energi consuming. have the courag to be vulner and accept one’ mistak is liberating. whether you accept it not, realiti is that mani time you will be wrong. by saying, “i wa wrong” more often – to yourself and other – you will find more compassion, humil and flexibility. peopl will trust you more. it is good to alway aim for the highest – as long as we understand that perfect is unattainable, both in work and in relationships. noth is perfect; even the earth is not perfectli round. you will invari make bad decisions. understand how often we are wrong make us be more compassion toward ourselves. we see that mani time we simpli did the best we could at that time – we need is to educ ourselves, not punish ourselves. we will also tend to criticis other less, and be more empathetic, which will improv our social relations. humil pay off. personally, it wa not easi for me to accept and practic thi lesson. but onc i tri a few times, i start take pleasur in it. there is a certain unburden of the heart that happens, which make it worth it even if onli for that feeling. my valu and point of view were chang by time, even to someth opposite, and i saw that contradict myself wa a sign of growth, not confus or unreliability. action step: is it hard for you to accept be wrong? if so, tri this: look back and see some opinion you had that you now see wa wrong. or mayb some bad decision. then clearli express that you were wrong to a person involv in that situation. depend on the magnitud of what happened, thi “little” act can save a relationship, a company, a life. . have some trust one of the qualiti of develop your spiritu is the trust on someth larger than yourself. call it god, the universe, dharma, life – doesn’t matter. it’ not about a whimsic expect that thing will happen accord to your preference, but a faith that thing will happen in favor of your greater good. it’ a convict that, if you put your best foot forward, the univers will respond. doe one realli need trust? no. but life is more beauti with it. trust in someth larger accomplish four import things: make you optimist (section ) decreas your worri and doubts, allow you to forget about the futur and focu more on the present forc you to accept thing you cannot chang take you out of your littl world you are less prone to mental masturb of “what if…” there is also scientif evid that trust make us happy. and here is a podcast episod where one of my guest speak about the valu of surrender. action step: is it time to take a leap of faith somewher in your life? how would your feel and action be differ if you had more trust? . dare to disagre “it’ alway better to be at the bottom of the ladder you want to climb than the top of the one you don’t” marc and angel chernoff. free yourself from the crowd mentality. be a lion. you will not find happi in the life of a sheep – at most comfort. the lion find hi own path, or carv one out if none is found. the sheep follow the beaten road. the lion walk alon if needed, and is fearless. the sheep is fear and move in herds. the lion roar loud and clear. the sheep’ sound is weak and hesitant. the lion rest deep, confid he can handl ani challenge. the sheep is worri about tomorrow. the lion make the news. the sheep read the news. the lion creat and innovates. the sheep follow standard and repeat patterns. the lion will fight, even though wounded. the sheep will run, even befor a fight. “be a light unto yourself”, as the buddha said. sing your own song. the world need your uniqu gift, presence, perspective. no need to apologis for your exist and your dreams. action step: are you be a sheep in ani place in your life? awaken the lion within. . money matters, but not realli what can money do for you, and how much of it do you realli need? it’ a huge topic. but for the purpos of thi post we can say there are broadli three type of attitud when it come to money: it’ not import (and other limit beliefs) it’ extrem import and the reason of my effort money is a resource, and it import for my life, but it’ not a measur of success or happi the first two will make you make you suffer. the balanc point of view will set you in the right path. there is plenti of research conclud that money doe matter, but that onc a certain threshold of comfort is achiev (some studi suggest ~k a year), it matter less and less to the overal wellb of the person. after the basic need of life of oneself and one’ famili are met, to continu to chase money is more a caus of dissatisfact than fulfil (refer to point number of thi post), especi if driven by peer comparison pressur and consumerism. the most valuabl thing money can buy is time, and it is how you use your time that will determin how happi you are. onc the point of comfort ha been reached, feel happi with what we have, and focus our effort on life’ intrins values, seem to be the best use of money. also, experi show that spend it on other can boost our happi more than spend it on ourselv (see also greatergood and sciencemag). action step: discov what is your attitud about money. are you hold ani limit beliefs, or over-focus on accumul wealth? . do your inner work all of these insight have one thing in common: they requir some inner work. these key are worthless unless you actual use them. you will need to put in some thought about yourself and your life, develop more self-awareness, and then decid to make a change. most peopl are not take thi path – they are simpli look for patches. solv one problem at it root and you will never need to solv it again. if you keep come back to the same problems, on the same level, then mayb someth is not right. no shortcut here. no silver bullet. just the pain of person growth – like give birth to your new self. design by you! the result pay off big time. the secret here is to fall in love with the process of growth. with the feel of free oneself from old shackles. enjoy the virtu we are developing. action step: creat some space in your life for self-awar and person development. noth will make a bigger impact than thi invest in yourself. think what could be your first step in thi journey. conclus wow, you actual read the whole post! i`m grate for your compani ? each of these point is actual quit a big subject, and i attempt to present it “briefly”. let me

183,28303,beforeitsnews.com,fake,http://beforeitsnews.com/celebrities/2014/05/can-we-prove-life-after-death-2-2463072.html,"headline: bitcoin & blockchain search exceed trump! blockchain stock are next! can the exist of life after death be proven? by: bob daulbi in a confus world of science, religion and societi at larg whereby, no two peopl or group seem to agre or reach some kind of common ground that we could all cling to with some hope, the exist of a life exist after death is an ever deepen problem to solve. perhap then, it can never be solv through a gener mean but by and through a person one instead. perhaps, proof of life after death wa never meant for the public at larg but onli for those willinmg to tread the path that angel fear to tread? what is the problem? if there is a problem at all when tri to establish the exist of a life after our pass here, it is proof. in have read mani articl concern thi topic, it can be easili seen that so mani of us have idea – and often, veri differ idea at that – but that i have yet to come across just one that will bring each of us thi much need proof. what about death anyway? although most of us will go through life not give anoth thought to our sure pass yet, there come a time in all our live when we are suddenli confront with death in such a way that we cannot ignor it ani longer. and so, we will ask ourselv then, “will i live on after thi life?” as far as i am concerned, death is not someth that we should push asid out of dread or ignor but is someth that we should studi as soon as we are abl to. thi is so that, when – not ‘if’ – we are confront with death, it will not come as a shock and, more importantly, it will also not be a sourc of grief either but rather, one of joy. exist (photo credit: vincepal) through instil religion, societi ha taught us to be afraid of death. to compound thi fear, we are also taught to ‘pooh-pooh’ or derid the possibl of life exist *after* death – wherebi we continu forev onward *anyway* – as a topic for the ‘ill-advised’ or the ‘ignorant’. to make matter even more fear and confus for us, experts, psychics, shamans, priests, minist or whoever, can not onli not bring us thi much need proof but that, should proof ever aris at all then no one agre that it is. it is becaus of thi lack of agreement – the need to reach common ground – that, we, the public at large, lose out. in short, if there weren’t quit so mani ego and wannab out there believ that they are the onli one who hold ‘the truth’ then, we would not suffer as we do as far as death and a life after death is concerned. and so, in bear these in mind, it becom all the more necessari to not onli find the exist of life after death but also to be abl to prove it leav us in no doubt that we too – *shall* live on. so, what about proof? in have now been in actual contact with our world beyond for a veri long time now, from my own experiences, i can now reveal that an all-round, gener proof, of a life exist after our death is a long way off if not nigh impossible. until scienc itself can reach a gener consensu – which is highli unlik (and thi becaus ‘they’ can’t agre either) – then the veri idea of find thi irrefut proof that will cross all boundari regardless of their origin – is but a distant dream. and so, when skeptic use thi angl – the need for the irrefut – is alreadi a lost argument and so, as they gain, believ lose. most of all, we all lose. so, what is to be done about this? gener vs. person proof dure my mani year of experi with our so-cal ‘unknown’, along the way, i have brought even total stranger to my session to note, not onli their reaction but also as to what they say is ‘proof’. it wa dure thi period of my research that i have discov that, although gener proof is not yet avail yet ‘personal’ proof is. not onli is person proof avail but it ha been avail sinc man first walk upon thi planet. let me give you an exampl of person proof. exist (photo credit: photosynthetica) when i first made friend with computers, got myself on the internet etc. to be in actual contact with someon from peru to me, wa an out and out miracle. but what compound that miracl wa that, after onli a month, i reciev a letter from him which prove to me that he exist and that he did inde come from peru. to me, thi wa person proof of someon i met through thi new fangl mean of commun at the time. the abov is person proof – for me and onli me and yet, to you, thi is all a fairi tale. why? becaus you were not there, you didn’t speak to him, you did not experi ani of thi and you did not reciev a letter from peru. thus, whi should you ‘believe’ me? had you not been taught geographi at school then, to you, even peru would not exist would it? ignor is also taught unlik me, you have not been taught about the true exist of life after death and so, to you, until you are taught then, you will alway doubt and you will alway requir proof. until you are taught; until you receiv your own person proof, thi proof will alway elud you. it’ time to learn isn’t it? and so, in have learn and shown that peru realli doe exist after all, what would the futur hold for someon who ha given up fickl ‘belief‘ altogeth and now *knows* at last? in conclusion: if you are curiou as to how you too can remov doubt and fear from your psychi so that you too can ventur out into land previous unknown to you; to also know, exactli what to expect upon your own pass and of how joy it truli is and whi in a veri real way leav behind you the insecur of tepid belief then, by all means, visit my websit where you too will find that the door to limitless knowledg await you too. sourc relat articl",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Can We Prove Life After Death?,,,[''],,,

[a lie] kaiser: it just hasn’t becom an issue. thi interview slip under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it wa buried. us econom and polit policy—run by a committe of the trilater commission. when jimmi carter won the presidenti elect in , hi aide, hamilton jordan, said that if after the inauguration, cy vanc and brzezinski came on board as secretari of state and nation secur adviser, “we’v lost. and i’ll quit.” lost—becaus both men were power member of the trilater commiss and their appoint to key posit would signal a surrend of white hous control to the commission. vanc and brzezinski were appoint secretari of state and nation secur adviser, as jordan feared. but he didn’t quit. he becam carter’ chief of staff. now consid the vast propaganda effort of the past years, on so mani levels, to instal the idea that all nation and peopl of the world are a singl collective. from a veri high level of polit and econom power, thi propaganda op ha had the object of groom the popul for a planet that is one coagul mass, run and manag by one force. a central engin of that forc is the trilater commission. how doe a shadowi group like the tc accomplish it goal? one basic strategi is: destabil nations; ruin their economies; send million and million of manufactur job off to place where virtual slave labor doe the work; ad insult to injury, export the cheap product of those slave-factori back to the nation who lost the job and undercut their domest competitors, forc them to close their door and fire still more employees. and then solv that econom chao by bring order. what kind of order? eventually, one planet, with nation border erased, under one manag system, with a plan global economy, “to restor stability,” “for the good of all, for last harmony.” “i pledg allegi to the trilater commission, and to the domin for which it stands, one planet, indivisible, with tyranni and poverti and top-down order for all…” deliv by the daili sheepl we encourag you to share and republish our reports, analyses, break news and video (click for details). contribut by jon rappoport of no more fake news. the author of an explos collection, the matrix revealed, jon wa a candid for a us congression seat in the th district of california. nomin for a pulitz prize, he ha work as an investig report for years, write articl on politics, medicine, and health for cb healthwatch, la weekly, spin magazine, stern, and other newspap and magazin in the us and europe. jon ha deliv lectur and seminar on global politics, health, logic, and creativ power to audienc around the world. source: http://www.thedailysheeple.com/flashback-when-the-rockefeller-trilateral-commission-exposed-its-own-secret_",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Flashback: When the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission Exposed its Own Secret,The Daily Sheeple,,[''],,,

magnesium is one of the most import element in the human body. it is a micronutri and miner that is involv in thousand of biochem process crucial for the proper function of the cardiovascular, alimentary, endocrine, and osteoarticular systems, but oddly, it seem absolut vital to regul our mood and level of happiness. in a breakthrough studi conduct by research at the larner colleg of medicin at the univers of vermont and publish in plo one ha found that just mg of magnesium per day lead to an about-fac of depress symptom in studi subjects. “new clinic research result show magnesium is effect at address symptom and is safer and easier on the wallet than prescript therapies,” report scienc daily. mound of research prove we need magnesium to combat depress research of thi kind regard magnesium isn’t new, but it stand to reinforc what nutritionists, health coaches, and even some psychologist have been state for decades. anoth studi state thi about magnesium and depression: “anxieti relat condit are the most common affect disord present in the gener popul with a lifetim preval of over %. magnesium (mg) statu is associ with subject anxiety, lead to the proposit that mg supplement may attenu anxieti symptoms.” and thi studi explain that: “after adjust for all potenti confounders, the strength of the associ of veri low magnesium intak with depress wa statist signific (rr = .; % ci, .-.).” or how about thi studi which state that the daili consumpt of mg magnesium: “. . . tablet for ≥ wk by depress patient suffer from magnesium defici lead to improv in depress statu and magnesium levels.” so, while not all the studi agre on the exact amount of magnesium that we need each day to combat depression, they repeat over and over in hundr of addit studies, that deplet magnesium level contribut to depression. whi we’r all magnesium defici deplet soil whi are so mani of us magnesium deficient, asid from the fact that mani vital micronutri and miner we need have been rape from the soil via industri farm practices, and by ad non-organic, toxic chemic fertil and herbicid to the veri soil which must grow our food? too much sugar we also eat too much sugar. is thi a coincidence? the sugar industri ha been hide the effect of sugar on us for decad – and one of those effect is that sugar eat up our magnesium stores. refin sugar caus you to wast most vitamin and miner in the body, mainli b-vitamins, potassium, magnesium, zinc and manganese. sugar rais co level in the blood, which caus you to go to bicarbon store which buffer it, caus a deplet of miner like magnesium. stress anoth culprit is stress – both mental and physic stress, with it relat continu flow of adrenaline, use up our magnesium store rapidly. adrenalin affect heart rate, blood pressure, vascular constrict and muscl contraction— action that all demand steadi suppli of magnesium for smooth function, and without it you can guess what happens. we also requir magnesium to creat serotonin, one of the “happi hormones” which prevent depression. stress caus less serotonin to be created, and replac it with cortisol and other stress hormones. stress and depress are inextric linked. without enough magnesium we haven’t got a chanc at fight depress naturally. detoxif magnesium is a power detoxifier. it remov everyth from heavi metals, to glyphos and other herbicid from our bodies, as well as thousand of environment toxin and metabol toxins. if we becom overli toxic, due to a lack of magnesium, we are more like be depress as the brain suffer from inflamm it cannot overcome. is it ani wonder we suffer from the follow addit diseases, asid from depression, all of which are link to magnesium deficiency? gastrointestin disorders: prolong diarrhea, crohn’ disease, malabsorpt syndromes, celiac disease, surgic remov of a portion of the intestine, and intestin inflamm due to radiat may all lead to magnesium depletion. renal disord (magnesium wasting): diabet mellitu and long-term use of certain diuret (see drug interactions) may result in increas urinari loss of magnesium. multipl other medic can also result in renal magnesium wasting. chronic alcoholism: poor dietari intake, gastrointestin problems, and increas urinari loss of magnesium may all contribut to magnesium depletion, which is frequent encount in alcoholics. age: sever studi have found that elderli peopl have rel low dietari intak of magnesium. intestin magnesium absorpt tend to decreas with age and urinari magnesium excret tend to increas with age; thus, suboptim dietari magnesium intak may increas the risk of magnesium deplet in the elderly. how much magnesium do i need and where can i get it?

overt overtur made toward beij by sever region countries, particularli malaysia and the philippines, are anoth defin factor. last november, malaysian prime minster najib razak made a six-day trip to china. dure that visit, which wa intend to elev their relationship to “greater heights”, kuala lumpur and beij sign mani new agreements, includ malaysia’ first major defens deal with china. two week befor that, presid rodrigo dutert also made a landmark trip to beijing, where he eventu and solemnli announc hi “separ from the us” and hi “dependence” on china, after month of publicli denounc washington and prais beijing. malaysia’ turn toward beij and especi the philippines’ dramat tilt away from it long-stand and most import alli to china’ orbit somehow influenc a rethink in hanoi. like vietnam, malaysia and the philippin have outstand territori disput with china in the south china sea. for years, they were among the region’ most vocal critic of their northern neighbor’ expans claim and aggress action in thi resource-rich and strateg vital water. they all favor multilater approach to the maritim disputes. hanoi support the philippines’ south china sea arbitr and welcom it landmark legal victori against china last july. duterte’ wholeheart embrac of china, which result in hi side-lin of the juli rule and agre to enter bilater talk with beij prompt vietnam to soften it postur and improv relat with china. last but not least, donald trump’ shock rise to the american presid is also a key reason behind hanoi’ current accommod postur toward beijing. under the obama administration, vietnam and america edg remark closer to each other. their stronger tie were strengthen by – and manifest in – mani key develop and agreements. promin among these are mr trong’ unpreced trip to washington in , presid obama’ mileston visit to vietnam in , dure which he offici end america’ decades-old arm embargo on it former war foe, and vietnam’ enthusiast respons to america’ asia pivot and the us-l tpp. vietnam’ strong econom and strateg tie with the us have been in jeopardi follow trump’ elect victory. face with the immin collaps of the tpp and other uncertainti about america’ relat with asia and vietnam under trump, hanoi is rel readjust it foreign polici and improv it tie with beij can be seen as part of such recalibration. but not a duterte-lik shift yet, while becom more recept to beijing, hanoi is not bandwagon with the latter; and thi is becaus of mani reasons. one of these concern vietnam’ econom imbal with china. though it ha drop recently, vietnam’ trade deficit with the world’ second biggest economi remain enormous. accord to it gener statist offic (gso), in , vietnam export (us)$. billion in good to the world’ largest trade countri and import $. billion from it. thi mean it had a trade deficit of $ billion with china last year. for years, hanoi ha ask beij to help balanc the bilater trade by creat better condit for vietnames good to enter the chines market. it is report that in hi talk with nguyen phu trong, xi jinp promis that china will work harder to make the two countries’ trade relat grow faster and becom more balanced. whether vietnam’ compani and their good are provid with a greater access to china follow trong’ visit remain to be seen. yet, in ani case, it will take year or decades, if ever, for vietnam to balanc it trade with china. for thi reason – and in order to avoid econom overdepend on it giant neighbor and to sustain it econom develop – vietnam need good relat with it other major trade partners, notabl the european union and the us, with which it ha enjoy a huge trade surplu in recent years. in , vietnam export us$ billion (in goods) to the eu, it third largest trade partner, and us$. billion to the us. as america is vietnam’ biggest export market and second largest trader, while it is unclear how donald trump will view and approach hi country’ relat with vietnam, it is certain that hanoi will tri it best to sustain and improv it tie with washington. anoth reason whi vietnam is seek better relat with the us and other powers, includ japan and india, is it unresolv maritim disput with china. dure trong’ china visit, both side pledg to manag maritim differ and avoid ani act that may complic the situat and escal tension in the south china sea. nevertheless, after “candidly” exchang their view on issue, they could not yet accept each other’ main position. accord to a report by the vov, vietnam’ nation radio broadcaster, in hi talk with hi chines counterpart, trong “assert vietnam’ consist stanc of persist deal with the disput in the east sea [vietnam’ name for the south china sea] by peac measur in complianc with intern law, includ the unit nation convent on the law of the sea (unclos), and with respect to diplomat and legal processes.” in contrast, as manifest by it vehement object to the philippines’ arbitr case, beij ha stringent oppos ani legal approach to resolv the disputes. instead, it ha forcibl insist on bilater negotiations. their joint communiqu mention neither of these two positions. given china’ expans claim and it past and recent action in the south china sea, vietnam doe not expect – though it strongli hope – that beij will willingli accept a peac solut to the disput base on the principl of intern law, includ unclos. that is whi it ha hedg – and continu to hedg – against ani aggress move by china by forg strong tie with global and region powers, notabl those that are also concern about beijing’ hegemon ambitions. thi is support by the fact that whilst trong wa hold talk with chines leader in beijing, in hanoi nguyen xuan phuc receiv john kerry. the latter’ visit might not have a major impact on futur us-vietnam cooperation. yet, in hi talk with the outgo us secretari of state, the vietnames premier express hi delight at achiev in us-vietnam relat and vietnam’ desir to reinforc bilater ties. thi show the vietnames leadership realli valu it relationship with washington. just a day after trong return from china, hanoi receiv shinzo abe. in their separ meet with the japanes prime minister, the southeast asian country’ top four leader – parti chief, state president, prime minist and parliament chairwoman – all affirm hanoi’ desir to deepen econom and strateg tie with japan. for hi part, dure thi two-day visit, mr abe pledg to provid vietnam with six new coastguard patrols. the patrol vessels, worth $ million, were part of the $-billion loan tokyo offer hanoi. vietnam-japan relat have significantli advanc in recent year and thi is mainli due to their share concern over china’ maritim ambit and actions. such apprehens have also brought vietnam closer to india, china’ other key region rival. six month ago, befor phuc’ china trip, hanoi host prime minist narendra modi. dure that landmark visit, the first offici trip to vietnam by an indian prime minist sinc , the two countri elev their “strateg partnership” to “comprehens strateg partnership” and new delhi agre to provid vietnam with a $ million defens loan. all of these demonstr that while it may priorit relat with beijing, hanoi is also seek stronger tie with other powers, notabl the us, japan and india, to counterbal china, both econom and strategically. it is also evid that the vietnames leadership is not overtli lean toward beij and submit to the latter’ maritim posit as presid dutert ha done. follow duterte’ china visit last october, dure which he publicli promis to shift hi country’ allegi from washington to beijing, some intern relat experts, notabl those from china, predict that america’ other asian partners, such as vietnam, may follow suit. ahead of trong’ visit last week, an articl in the global times, a spin-off of the people’ daily, the cpc’ mouthpiece, also suggest that the shift in diplomaci by the philippin leader “set a good exampl for the other southeast asian countries, includ vietnam.” judg by mr trong’ assert of vietnam’ maritim posit in hi talk with the chines leader and other diplomat and strateg move recent taken by hanoi, it is appar that vietnames leader are not follow mr duterte’ step or “example”. instead, they remain firmli commit to their long-held foreign polici of independence, diversif and multilater that ha enabl vietnam to develop good – and gener fruit – relat with mani countries, includ all the world’ major power and the region’ countries. atimes.com",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Is

223,36475,strategic-culture.org,unknown,https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2013/02/26/the-return-of-empires-ii.html,"the return of empir (ii) part i a world of postmodern or the newest middl ages? the process alreadi take shape in the world of consolid «larger spaces», and the return of the empir of by-gon era may not, at first glance, seem to respond to the spirit of the times. however, we are live in an age which, in view of it uncertainti in people' minds, is indiscrimin to such an extent that it is no stranger to the most improb polici prescriptions. the world is in a state of interregnum in which, as zygmunt bauman says, «chang is the onli constant, and the unknown - the onli certainty»; in thi world, europ remain a battlefield, but nowaday the battl is between a westphalian model of sovereign state and new form of supran governance… tradit european empir of modern times, which is to say the modern age, have risen up on the ruin of feudalism. however, it is a peculiar of postmodern that it is ready, on a fairli eclect basis, to take on the organis form of polit relat of ani era. piracy, which wa onc from time of old (rememb the famou algerian pirates) is today onc again firmli establish itself along the shore of africa; a by-effect, of course, but it ha becom indic of a time in which the archaic and the modern intermingl in the most unimagin way possible. thi is noth new, however. similar era breakdown have taken place time and again. the russian philosoph nikolai berdyaev, in hi work written between the two world war entitl «the new middl ages», wrote: «we are destin to live in a histor time of era change». berdyaev refer to thi time as «the end of new histori and the begin of a new middl ages», defin it as a transit from the ration of new histori to the irration of a mediev type... «the spiritu begin of past histori are be eliminated, it spiritu power exhausted... all the usual categori of thought and form of life of the most «advanced», «progressive», even «revolutionary» peopl of the th and th centuri are hopelessli outdat and have lost all mean for the present and especi for the future». accord to berdyaev' observations, the transit to a new middl ages, just the same as the previou transit to an «old» middl ages, is accompani by a notic expans of old societi and the indiscern addit of new ones. «individu ha elimin all of it possibl in new history, there is no longer ani energi left in it... the end of the spirit of individu is the end of new history... liberalism, democracy, parliamentarianism, constitutionalism, legal formalism, humanitarian morals, rationalist and empir philosophi are all the offspr of an individualist spirit, of a humanitarian self-assertiveness, and they are all die away, they are all lose their former importance... is there much that is ontolog real about stock exchanges, bank and money, about monstrou factori produc useless object or weapon for destroy life, about superfici luxuries, speech by parliamentarian and lawyers, about newspap articles? is there much that is real about the growth of insati demands?» the russian philosoph note that christian had previous play a unifi role for at least a substanti proport of mankind. it veri exist «signifi an escap from pagan nation and particularism». at the end of new history, «we are onc again see befor us an unfett world of pagan particularism, insid which there is a deadli battl and destruct take place». however, mani of berdyaev' idea do not seem to be so pertin these days; it would obvious be wrong to place an equal sign between the time in which he wrote and the begin of the st century. although the turn of the histor spiral are link with each other, each one is also unique, and sinc the new middl age ha alreadi taken place, then in imit of berdyaev it might be possibl to call the trend of our time the newest middl ages. one of the most notic featur of thi period, for example, is the emerg of variou complex networks, and not just network of an information-technolog and sociolog nature, but also those encompass relat between states. strategi for use network warfar to control nation are extrem popular in washington. the pentagon, in particular, ha offici adopt a new militari doctrin of net-centr warfar aim at «superior knowledge» and «inform dominance». () at the same time, our internationally-network world with it appar independ of individu centr of power which are, in fact, incorpor into more complex hierarch relat and interdepend surprisingli remind one, in an ontolog sense, of the world of the middl ages. in particular, a system of multilay vassalag is form befor our veri eye in which there will no longer be a suprem «lieg lord» as befor (becaus he cannot and doe not want to do it), interf in liter everyth to do with the ruler in hi area of domin on the principl of «a vassal of my vassal is not my vassal». washington understand that it is both financi and physic imposs to delv into the particular of all world powers, but that is exactli what they have been tri to do there so far and with increas amount of effort. it is simpler to choos half a dozen or a dozen trust agent («vassals») and entrust/trust them to do it, control them themselves. thi is whi some of the recent action of america' close allies, first and foremost france, are so similar to the principl of distribut feudal lands. it is probabl possibl to talk about a plan for a kind of super empir in place of a sole super power which, on the basi of the network principle, would be subordin to the region or tradit empir current acquir a new leas of life. the centr would be the same, but now it would be more like a coordin than a straight omnipres steward; it would be consider more econom and consequently, or so the american are hoping, no less efficient. full sovereignty, meanwhile, includ the right to militari intervention, would undoubtedli be centr at the top of thi pyramid. as the well-known american academ noam chomski writes, the principl of intern order lie in the fact that the unit state ha the right to use violenc whenev they like. and nobodi els ha that right . «of cours not. well, mayb our client do. so they inherit the right. other american client do, too. but the right realli resid in washington. that' what it mean to own the world. it' like the air you breathe. you can't question it». () in fact today, on a new turn of history, a neofeud system of vassal depend is re-establish itself in the world which, in it day, replac the mighti rome. today' rome is washington, which in mani way is in exactli the same state of imperi exhaustion, includ moral, and which in realiti is tri to continu it hegemoni use exactli the same methods, although with the veri latest technology; but realli it make no different, it is onli techniqu and there is noth new in that. neo-vassalag ha a lot of benefits. firstly, if someth is go wrong, it is alway possibl to make it seem like the one respons is not who is realli pull the strings, name washington, but the vassal state. use thi vassal, it is complet possibl to deni one' own involv in the fate of other state and pull on the robe of imparti arbitrator. secondly, such a mechan for project global power also allow for the cost of manag territori to be kept to a minimum, which is rather import given the global financi crisis. at the same time, while set about reorganis the world, washington also need to factor in the cost that thi would bring. at some point, the interest of the main lieg lord may not coincid with the interest of larg vassal capabl of obstinacy. furthermore, those against whom thi game is be direct may be in a posit to set about strengthen their own alliances, the contour of which are alreadi discernible. consequently, while on the way to put it plan into action, washington still ha a number of complex problem to solve.
