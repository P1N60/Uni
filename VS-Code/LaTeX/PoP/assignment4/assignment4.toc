\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.a}What is a data type?\\ Explain what it is using the definitions given in PoP. Illustrate the role data types play when representing data in Python, using examples from the thursday worksheets in week 13, 14 or 15.}{4}{subsection.2.1}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.b}Representing colours\\ Consider the colouring problem that Ken introduced in class. In the context of this problem, describe three possible way to represent colour in Python. Explain in detail how the different representations impact the canExtendColour function (both its signature and its body).}{5}{subsection.2.2}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.c}URepresenting NeighbourRelation\\ Consider the colouring problem that Ken introduced in class. In Ken's solution, the type NeighbourRelation is a list of pairs of Countries. A list of pairs is a way to represent a graph (each pair represents an edge between the components of the pair that are vertices). Define a NeighbourRelation type as a recursive data structure, in Python.}{5}{subsection.2.3}%

\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4}Question 4\\ Consider the following problem involving a collection of cards. Each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. The first winning number you have is worth one point. Every other winning number doubles your number of points. For example:}{7}{section.4}%
