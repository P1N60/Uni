\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}In 2021 DIKU celebrated its 50th anniversary with a lot of pomp, although slightly less emphasis was given to the fact that it was done one year late due to the Covid pandemic. Even less publicity was given to the public outreach day organized in F\ae lledsparken for school children by the Algorithms and Complexity Section as part of the anniversary, for reasons that might become clearer after you have studied the problems below.}{8}{section.2}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.a}In one of the events of the AC Section outreach day, Jakob had arranged so that 51 children were given brightly coloured balls, and were positioned in a field in such a way that all the pairwise distances between the children were distinct. The children were then asked to identify which other child was closest to them and, at a given signal, to throw their ball to this child (and hopefully also receive an incoming ball from somewhere). This turned out to be a public relations catastrophe. However, the children were positioned as described above, every time at least one child ended up without a ball (but instead with tears in the eyes). This did not at all generate the goodwill DIKU was hoping for. What went wrong? Was Jakob just immensely unlucky? Or can you prove mathematically that it was unavoidable that at least one child would end up without a ball? Would this have been different if Jakob had not insisted on 51 children, but had accepted the proposal by his colleagues to have 50 children? Or if not all distances would have had to be different?}{8}{subsection.2.1}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.b}In another event, Jakob built a 5-kilometre car track across the park. On this track, 51 electric cars were placed at random locations (but all pointing in the same direction clockwise around the circuit). One car battery was sufficient for exactly one full lap if charged to 100\% capacity. However, instead the batteries of all the cars were charged partially in such a way that the total charge of all the batteries together was sufficient for one car to travel exactly the full distance of 5 kilometres. After this, the batteries were distributed to the cars in some random way.}{9}{subsection.2.2}%
\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {2.c}In the final event of the day, a big $2^n$-by-$2^n$ grid was constructed, after which one cell in the grid was removed by placing a black square on it as illustrated in Figure 1a. The children were then given the task to cover all the other cells in the grid by placing L-shaped tiles in such a way that every cell was covered exactly once, and nothing outside of the grid was covered, as shown in Figure 1b. By now the children were fairly fed up with these strange games, however, and Jakob’s colleagues also started getting a bit annoyed, wondering if the strange shape of the tiles was somehow a not-so-subtle attempt to push for a competing foreign university at the other side of the Øresund strait instead, and the day did not end on a festive note at all. Disregarding this unfortunate turn of events, can you prove that it is actually true that for any $2^n$-by-$2^n$ grid, regardless of how it is punctured by removing a cell, it is always possible to tile the rest of the grid with L-shaped tiles?}{9}{subsection.2.3}%
